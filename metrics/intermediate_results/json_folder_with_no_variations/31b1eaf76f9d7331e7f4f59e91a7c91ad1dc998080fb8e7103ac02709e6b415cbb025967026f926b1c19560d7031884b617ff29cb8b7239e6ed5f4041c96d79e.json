    "Master Answer": "In BC, individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals. Adults born before 1970 that did not have measles in childhood, one dose of\u00a0Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine\u00a0may be offered by an immunizing health care provider. Adults born before 1970 with one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, a second dose would not be recommended under the publicly funded (free) immunization program.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "I got the single-dose MMR as a child. My doctor won't do a blood test to see if I have full immunity. I was born in 1968 but did NOT have measles as a child. I want an MMR booster but no clinic or pharmacy will do one due to my age. How do I get the MMR booster?\n",
