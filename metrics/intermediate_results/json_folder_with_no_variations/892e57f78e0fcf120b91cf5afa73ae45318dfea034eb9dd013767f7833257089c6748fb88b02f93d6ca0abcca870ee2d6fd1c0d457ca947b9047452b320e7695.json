    "Master Answer": "You can request a record of your child's immunizations from your local health unit. \u00a0\nSome vaccines are routinely recommended for all young adults (including a tetanus/diphtheria booster every 10 years, a Tdap booster, and a yearly influenza vaccine). Other vaccines may be recommended depending on age, job, lifestyle, health conditions, travel plans, and vaccines received in the past. A public health nurse can review your child's record and tell you if they are up to date on their routine vaccines, if other vaccines are recommended, and when booster doses are needed. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\u00a0 You can find more information on vaccines recommended for adults here. \u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
