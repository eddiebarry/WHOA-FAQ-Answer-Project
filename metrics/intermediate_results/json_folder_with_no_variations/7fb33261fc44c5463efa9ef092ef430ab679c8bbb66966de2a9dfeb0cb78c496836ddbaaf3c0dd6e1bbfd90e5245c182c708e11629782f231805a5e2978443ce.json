    "Master Answer": "Yes, you can get a TB test a few days after the flu shot. Inactivated vaccines (like flu) can be given on the same day or at any time before or after a TB test is done. MMR is a live vaccine. A TB test can be done before or on the same day that a live virus vaccine is given. However, if a live vaccine is given on the previous day or earlier, the TB test should be delayed for at least 4 weeks (28 days). If a live vaccine is given before\u00a0 the TB test, it can reduce the reactivity of the skin test because of mild suppression of the immune system and result in a false negative. For further questions, please contact your immunization provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
