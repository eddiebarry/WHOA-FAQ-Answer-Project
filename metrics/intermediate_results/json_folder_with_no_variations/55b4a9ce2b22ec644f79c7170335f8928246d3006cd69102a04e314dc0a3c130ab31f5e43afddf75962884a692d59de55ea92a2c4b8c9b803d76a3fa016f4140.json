    "Master Answer": "For best protection against disease, it's advised that children get vaccinated on time starting at 2 months of age and that they follow the recommended schedule as closely as possible. However, for doses of vaccine to be considered valid, they do have to meet criteria for timing between doses (e.g. 4-8 weeks between doses) and minimum age (e.g. 6 months of age for influenza vaccine).\nA health care provider can review your baby's vaccine record and determine if she is eligible for her routine 6 month vaccines now or if due to scheduling March is the earliest possible date for next set of vaccines. Speak with a nurse at your health unit. Find your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "My baby's appointment for 6th-month immunization will be on March, when she'll be almost 9 months old. Is it risky to wait that long?\n",
