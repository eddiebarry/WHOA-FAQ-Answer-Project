    "Master Answer": "Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that all adults receive one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if they have not previously received a pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood. In particular, adults who have not previously received a pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine. Ensuring your pertussis vaccination is up-to-date can provide indirect protection to infants.\nDue to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC, an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood. \u00a0A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults\u00a0who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown. \u00a0Those not eligible for the free vaccine can purchase it at most pharmacies and travel clinics\nFor more information about the Tdap vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine.\u00a0\n",
