    "Master Answer": "You can get travel vaccines from your local travel clinic. You can find a list of travel clinics in B.C. here. A nurse or doctor at the travel clinic can tell you which vaccines you need for your travel destination. Travel vaccines are also available from some pharmacies and doctor's offices.\u00a0\nPlease consult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before you travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose.\nYou can find more information on travel vaccines here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
