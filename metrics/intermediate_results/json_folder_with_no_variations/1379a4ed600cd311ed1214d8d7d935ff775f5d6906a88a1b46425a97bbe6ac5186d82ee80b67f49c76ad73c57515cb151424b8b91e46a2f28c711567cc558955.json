    "Master Answer": "No. \u00a0You cannot get shingles from another person. Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox). When a person is first infected with the varicella-zoster virus, they get chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant (inactive) in the body. \u00a0For reasons that are not fully known,\u00a0the virus can become active again later in life, causing shingles.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n\n",
    "Master Question": "Can you get shingles from contact with someone who was immunized with the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine? Or from contact with someone with chickenpox disease? \u00a0\u00a0\n",
