    "Master Answer": "A 15-month-old would need to get immunized at a public health clinic or doctor's office (if their doctor provides immunizations). Pharmacists only immunize children 5 years of age and older. Please contact your local health unit for information on flu clinics for young children in your area. You can also use our flu clinic locator to find a list of public health flu clinics near you. Please note that the flu clinic locator is currently being populated with clinic information for the 2019-20 influenza season, and clinics are still being added.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
