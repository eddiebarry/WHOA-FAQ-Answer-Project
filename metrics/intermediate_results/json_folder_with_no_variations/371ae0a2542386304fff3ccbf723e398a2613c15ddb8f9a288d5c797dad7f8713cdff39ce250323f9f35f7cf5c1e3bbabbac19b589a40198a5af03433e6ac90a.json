    "Master Answer": "Household or close contacts of immunosuppressed persons should continue to receive their routine vaccinations. Very rarely, a person who develops a rash after being immunized can spread the virus from the chickenpox vaccine. To prevent spreading it to others, cover the rash until the blisters have dried and crusted over. If this is not possible, there should be limited contact with someone who is both susceptible to chickenpox and has a suppressed immune system for the duration of the rash.
