    "Master Answer": "We do not have information on PharmaCare coverage. You will need to contact PharmaCare for this information.\nBC's publicly funded immunization program provides a variety of vaccines for protection against infectious diseases. The shingles vaccine is not part of BC's publicly funded immunization program.\u00a0 In BC, decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations from the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee, chaired by the Provincial Health Officer.\u00a0 This expert committee looks at recommendations from Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (including those related to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness) as well as provincial epidemiology (how often the disease occurs in different groups of people in the province), economic analyses, and a variety of other considerations. Recommendations for new vaccine programs or expansions are also weighed by the Ministry of Health against other new health initiatives. You can find more information on the shingles vaccines here.\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
