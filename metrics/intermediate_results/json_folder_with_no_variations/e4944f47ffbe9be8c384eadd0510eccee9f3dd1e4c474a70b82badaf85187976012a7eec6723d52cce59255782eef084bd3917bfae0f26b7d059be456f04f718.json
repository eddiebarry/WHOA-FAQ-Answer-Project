    "Master Answer": "Vaccine safety is important. It is often hard to tell if a reaction was caused by the vaccine, or if it was caused by something else. If you suspect you have had a serious or unexpected event following receipt of a vaccine, please contact your immunization provider to discuss your symptoms and recommendation for your 2nd dose of Shingrix vaccine.\nYou can also contact your local health unit and ask to speak with a nurse. Our health unit finder is here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "Due to a very bad reaction to the 1st dose of Shingrix, I am hesitant to get the 2nd dose. Do I have some vaccine coverage in my system after just the one dose? I am still suffering from the affects of severe gouty arthritis in my dominant right wrist/hand. Started 2 wks after 1st dose-3 wks now.\n",
