    "Master Answer": "Please speak with the healthcare professional that provided the vaccine, to answer questions specific to your child. You can speak with a nurse at a health unit, use our finder\u00a0to contact a clinic near you.\nVaccines are very safe. Hepatitis B vaccine is an inactivated vaccine. Inactivated vaccines contain whole or parts of an inactivated (killed) bacteria or viruses and cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent. In general, it is not harmful to give extra doses of the routine childhood vaccines.\u00a0 An extra dose stimulates the immune system to be even more protective. For example, babies who are born at high risk of hepatitis B infection receive four doses of the vaccine to ensure they are protected against this disease in BC.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
