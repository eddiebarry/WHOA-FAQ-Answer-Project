    "Master Answer": "The tetanus vaccine is not available on its own.\u00a0 The tetanus vaccine is combined with other vaccines so a person can receive protection from several diseases with one shot. \u00a0Several different vaccines are used to prevent tetanus among infants, children, adolescents and adults.\u00a0 The vaccine routinely given to adults as a booster dose is the Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine. \u00a0\nAdults who were immunized against tetanus and diphtheria when they were younger should get a booster dose of the Td vaccine every 10 years. This booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases. \u00a0\nYou can find more information about tetanus and tetanus vaccines here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
