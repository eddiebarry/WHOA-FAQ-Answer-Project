    "Master Answer": "In BC, it is not recommended to give medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen to a baby before routine immunizations. A baby may experience fever, injection site pain and cry or be fussy following immunization. Speak with a health care provider who can help you determine the type/amount of fever/pain medication to give your child based on their age/weight.\nFor the alleviation of fever and pain, parents can:\n\n\t\tApply a clean, cool wet washcloth for 15-20 minutes over the immunization site(s).\n\n\t\tGive acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae\u00a0). Alternatively, ibuprofen can be given, however, it should not be given to children less than 6 months of age without first speaking to their health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
