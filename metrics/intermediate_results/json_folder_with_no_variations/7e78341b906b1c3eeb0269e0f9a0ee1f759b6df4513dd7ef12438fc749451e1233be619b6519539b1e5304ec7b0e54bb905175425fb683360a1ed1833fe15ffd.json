    "Master Answer": "There are a number of different vaccines that protect against tetanus.\u00a0 The vaccine you will be getting depends on your age and your immunization history.\u00a0\nThe Td vaccine is used in Canada, not the DT vaccine.\u00a0 The Td vaccine protects against tetanus and diphtheria. This vaccine is routinely given as a booster dose to adults every 10 years and is also given to adults who have not been immunized.\u00a0 The vaccine may also be given to people with serious cuts of deep wounds if their last tetanus vaccine was given more than 5 years ago.\u00a0\nDiphtheria is a serious infection of the nose and throat caused by diphtheria bacteria.\nYou can learn more about the Td vaccine and about tetanus and diphtheria in the HealthLinkBC File: Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
