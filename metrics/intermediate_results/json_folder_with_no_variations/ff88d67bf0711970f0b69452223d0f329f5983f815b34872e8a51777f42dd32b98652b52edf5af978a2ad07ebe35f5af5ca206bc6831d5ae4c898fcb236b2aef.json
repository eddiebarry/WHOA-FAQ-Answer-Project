    "Master Answer": "Individuals who developed Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome (GBS)\u00a0within 8 weeks of a previous dose of tetanus toxoid or influenza vaccine should not be re-immunized with that product. Individuals who have developed GBS outside this interval or who have a different etiology (cause) confirmed may receive subsequent doses of tetanus and/or influenza vaccines.\nWhile its cause of GBS is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows infection with a virus or bacteria. If you have more questions, please speak with your health care provider about your health history and risk of GBS from influenza virus versus vaccine. Studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind that severe illness and death are associated with flu, and getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent flu infection and its complications.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
