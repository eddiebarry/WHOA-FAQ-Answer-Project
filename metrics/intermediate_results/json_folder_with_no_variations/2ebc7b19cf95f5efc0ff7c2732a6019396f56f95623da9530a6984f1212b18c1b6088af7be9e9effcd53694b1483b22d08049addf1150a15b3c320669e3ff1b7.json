    "Master Answer": "The inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine is approved for people ages 6 months and older.\u00a0 Influenza vaccines are safe. \u00a0Vaccines are among the safest tools of modern medicine.\nThe influenza vaccine is the best way to protect against influenza, a serious and sometimes fatal infection.\nCanada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older gets an influenza vaccine, with rare exception. \u00a0In BC, the influenza vaccine is provided free to people at high risk of serious illness from influenza (this includes children 6 months to less than 5 years of age) and to people able to transmit or spread influenza to those at high risk.\nIf you have questions about the safety of influenza vaccines, we recommend that you speak with your doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\nFor more information about influenza vaccines, see the HealthLinkBC File: Inactivated Influenza (Flu) Vaccine and our influenza page.\u00a0\n",
