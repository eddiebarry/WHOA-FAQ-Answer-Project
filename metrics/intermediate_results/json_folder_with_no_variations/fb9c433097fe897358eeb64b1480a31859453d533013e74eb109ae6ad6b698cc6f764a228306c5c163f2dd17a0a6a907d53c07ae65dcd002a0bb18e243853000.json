    "Master Answer": "ImmunizeBC does not provide travel vaccine advice. Please speak with the health care professional who provided your last dose of\u00a0Twinrix\u00ae\u00a0 or make an appointment at a travel health clinic to review your vaccine records. Find a travel health clinic near you here. \u00a0Our Travellers section is here.\nFor almost all vaccines (except for oral typhoid vaccine), an interruption of a vaccine series does not require starting the series over again, regardless of the time between doses. Twinrix\u00ae (combined hepatitis A & B vaccine) is given to adults as three dose series over six months. Travel health clinics also do a rapid dosing vaccine schedule. Protection (immunity) may not be attained until the recommended number of doses has been administered.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
