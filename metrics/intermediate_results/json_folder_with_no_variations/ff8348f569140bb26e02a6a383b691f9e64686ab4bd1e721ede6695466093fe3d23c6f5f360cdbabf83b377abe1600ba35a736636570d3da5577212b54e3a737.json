    "Master Answer": "We assume you are referring to getting vaccinated without a B.C. Services Card. If you live in B.C., you and your family can receive publicly funded (free) vaccines that you meet the eligibility criteria for at no cost. We recommend that you book immunizations at your local health unit. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here. Publicly funded (free) vaccines are also available from some pharmacies and doctors' offices. However, you may be charged a vaccine administration fee at these places without a B.C. Services Card.\u00a0\nIf you have further questions about this, please contact your local health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
