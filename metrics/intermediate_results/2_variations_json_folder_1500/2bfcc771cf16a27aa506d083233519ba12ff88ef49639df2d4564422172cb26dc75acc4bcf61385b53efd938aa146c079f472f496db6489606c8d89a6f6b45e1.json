    "Master Answer": "If you have not been vaccinated for some vaccine preventable diseases or not had those diseases and you are around an unvaccinated child who has the disease, you or your baby could be at risk. If you have received the vaccine, you and your baby should be protected. However, some vaccines do not offer lifetime protection and so there are some vaccines recommended for pregnant women. You can find more information here. If you have concerns about being around unvaccinated children, we recommend you discuss your concerns with a public health nurse who can provide you with more information. You can find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
