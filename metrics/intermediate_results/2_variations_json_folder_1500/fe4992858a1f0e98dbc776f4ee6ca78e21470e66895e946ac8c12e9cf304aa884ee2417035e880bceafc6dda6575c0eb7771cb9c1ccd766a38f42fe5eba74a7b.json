    "Master Answer": "In BC, the routine infant schedule is a 2, 4 and 6 months of age; read more about why your child needs to get vaccinated on time\u00a0here.\u00a0The recommended schedule is designed to protect babies early in life, when they are most vulnerable, and before they are potentially exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases. At times, because of parent schedules or clinic wait lists, the next available appointment may result in your infant not being immunized exactly at 2 months of age.\nSchedule your baby's immunization appointments as soon as possible. Our text message reminder system may also be helpful and is found here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
