    "Master Answer": "\n\t\tFor children under 4 years of age who have received one dose of MMR vaccine, the second dose is given at 4 \u20ac\u201c 6 years of age.\n\n\t\tIt is not routinely recommended to receive the second dose of MMR vaccine earlier (i.e., before 4 years of age).\n\n\t\tHowever, if your child is younger than 4 years of age and traveling overseas to an area with high rates of\u00a0measles, an early second dose is recommended prior to travel. This dose can be given as early as 4 weeks after the first dose. To receive vaccines related to travel, contact a travel health clinic.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
