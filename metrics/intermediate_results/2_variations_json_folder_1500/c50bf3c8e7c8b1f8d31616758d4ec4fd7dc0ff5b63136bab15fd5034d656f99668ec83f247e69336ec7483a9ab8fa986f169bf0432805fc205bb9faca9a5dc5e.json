    "Master Answer": "Protection from the pertussis vaccine decreases with time. Exactly how long protection from the vaccine lasts is unknown. However, studies suggest that the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine protects about 7 out of 10 adolescents in the first year after getting the vaccine. The protection provided by the vaccine then decreases with each year since the vaccine was given. Protection against pertussis infection four or more years after vaccination is expected to be low.\nA booster dose of the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who were immunized in childhood but is not provided for free in B.C. You can find more information about the Tdap vaccine in the HealthLinkBC File: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine.\n- Immunization Nurse\n\t\u00a0\n",
