    "Master Answer": "In BC, the measles vaccine is not available on its own. Instead,\u00a0measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)\u00a0protection is available in a combination vaccine.\u00a0Combination vaccines are safe. Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into a single injection (shot) so that you can get protection against several diseases at once.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
