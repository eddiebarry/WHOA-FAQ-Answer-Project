    "Master Answer": "Currently, immunization is not mandatory in BC, however, starting this school year, parents and guardians will be expected to provide the immunization status of their children to their local public health unit.\u00a0 Mandatory reporting of the immunization status of students will ensure the public health system is prepared in the event of an outbreak. With the up-to-date records, public health can reach out to families with children behind on their immunizations and provide an opportunity to catch them up, as well as discuss any concerns with parents.\nYou can find more information on Immunization Status Reporting here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
