    "Master Answer": "Please speak with your health care provider about your health and if your immune system is compromised. Shingrix\u00ae (shingles vaccine) may be considered for immunocompromised adults 50 years of age and older. The viruses that cause ocular herpes and shingles are different.\n\n\t\tEye herpes (ocular herpes) is a common, recurrent viral infection affecting the eyes caused by the type 1 herpes simplex virus.\n\n\t\tChickenpox infection is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The chickenpox virus stays in the body and later in life it can become reactivated causing shingles (herpes zoster).\n\n\t\tShingrix\u00ae is an inactivated (non live) shingles vaccine and cannot cause a shingles outbreak.\n\n\t\tRead more about shingles and the vaccines here\nImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
