    "Master Answer": "The chickenpox vaccine contains a weakened form of the varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes chickenpox).\u00a0 The vaccine-strain of the virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles. However, the risk of getting shingles from the vaccine-strain of the virus is much lower than the risk of getting shingles after natural infection with the virus. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe shingles vaccine is not publicly funded in BC.\u00a0 In BC, decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations by the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee.\u00a0 This expert committee makes recommendations based on epidemiology, the best available scientific evidence, a cost benefit analysis and the advice of national and international expert groups, which are then prioritized against other public health initiatives.\u00a0 Some health insurance plans may cover the cost of the shingles vaccine.\u00a0\n",
