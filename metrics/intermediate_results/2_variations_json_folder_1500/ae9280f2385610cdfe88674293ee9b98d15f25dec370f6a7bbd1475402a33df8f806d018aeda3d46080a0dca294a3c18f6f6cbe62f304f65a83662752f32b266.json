    "Master Answer": "For best protection, it is advised that children receive all of the recommended vaccines on time. \u00a0We recommend that you contact your immunizing health care provider (public health nurse or physician). \u00a0Your health care provider can provide you with more information and discuss your options with you, including the option of your son getting his18 month immunization early and prior to leaving Canada. \u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\nIt is also recommended that you consult a travel health professional to determine if your child needs any additional vaccines that are not part of the routine schedule prior to traveling.\u00a0 A travel health professional can also inform you of the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the area you are traveling to. You can find a list of travel clinics in BC here.\nFor most vaccines, it's never too late to catch up on missing vaccines. \u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
