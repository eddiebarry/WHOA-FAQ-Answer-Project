    "Master Answer": "Cold chain is an important part of what healthcare professionals do to ensure vaccines work (are effective).\n\"Cold chain\" refers to the process used to maintain temperature during the transport, storage and handling of vaccines. This begins at the manufacturer (where the vaccine is made) and ending with administration of the vaccine to you or your child. Monitoring of cold chain ensures vaccines have been stored and transported at recommended temperatures and in correct conditions. If you have more questions about cold chain, speak with a nurse at your local health unit. Find a clinic near you here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
