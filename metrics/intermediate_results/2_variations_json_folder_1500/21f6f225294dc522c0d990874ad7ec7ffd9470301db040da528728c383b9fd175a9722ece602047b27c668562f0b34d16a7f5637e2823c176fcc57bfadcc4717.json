    "Master Answer": "The HPV vaccines are given as either 2 or 3 doses over a 6 month period. Children who are 9 to 14 years of age need 2 doses given at least 6 months apart. People 15 years of age and older need 3 doses. Interruption of a recommended vaccine series does not require starting the series over again, regardless of the interval elapsed (with the exception of the oral typhoid vaccine). However, protection cannot be assured until the recommended number of doses have been received.\nWe recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse who can do a more thorough assessment of this specific situation.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
