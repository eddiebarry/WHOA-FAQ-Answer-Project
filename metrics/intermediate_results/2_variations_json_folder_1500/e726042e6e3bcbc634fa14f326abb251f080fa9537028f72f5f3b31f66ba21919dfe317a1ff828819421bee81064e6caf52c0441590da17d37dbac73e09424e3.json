    "Master Answer": "There is no central registry of all immunizations provided in BC. If you do not have a copy of your child's immunization records, there are several places you can look. Tips for locating immunization records are here.\u00a0\nUse the health unit finder\u00a0to contact your local health unit. Tell them if your child was immunized in other areas of BC when requesting a record. Your local health unit may not have some of the records given in other areas (due to paper records, different online record systems, etc).\nImmunization Nurse\n",
