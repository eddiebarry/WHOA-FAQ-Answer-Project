    "Master Answer": "For best protection, it is recommended that children adhere as closely as possible to the recommended schedule.\nPostponing the 6 month vaccination is an option, however the risk with postponing vaccines is that it leaves children at risk for disease longer and at a time when they are most vulnerable. \u00a0\nWhether or not your child can receive the 6 month vaccination early (and it be considered a valid dose) depends on the minimum intervals for the vaccine (these are the required amounts of time that must pass between vaccine doses) and the minimum age for that dose. \u00a0However, in certain situations, such as travel, vaccination may still be recommended even if minimum interval and age requirements are not met.\u00a0\nWe recommend that you follow up with your immunizing health care provider who can make a recommendation for your child.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
