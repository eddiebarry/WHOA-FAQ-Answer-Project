    "Master Answer": "Mandatory immunization programs for children are not anywhere in Canada, including BC.\u00a0However, it is strongly recommended that children and adults are up-to-date with their immunizations. BC Routine immunization schedules are here.\nIn BC, there is not a requirement to provide immunization records or documentation of valid exemptions to immunization to public health. Public health staff obtain immunization records of children through a voluntary process. These records are entered into the immunization registry, and available for rapid retrieval when needed; the information is also used to remind children/ parents about needed vaccines.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
