    "Master Answer": "Individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection. This means that if you had measles disease in childhood you are immune and do not need the\u00a0Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine. If you were born before 1970 and are uncertain if you had measles disease, discuss this with your health care provider. If you have questions about measles, speak with a nurse at HealthlinkBC anytime by calling 8-1-1.\nImmunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
