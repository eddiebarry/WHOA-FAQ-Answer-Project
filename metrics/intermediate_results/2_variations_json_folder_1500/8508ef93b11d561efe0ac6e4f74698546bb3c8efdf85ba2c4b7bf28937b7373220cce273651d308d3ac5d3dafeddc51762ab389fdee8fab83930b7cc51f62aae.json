    "Master Answer": "Vaccines contain a small amount of the germs or parts of the germs that cause disease. The germs in vaccines are either killed or weakened so they can't make you sick. When you receive a vaccine, your body thinks the small amount of the disease germ is the disease itself, and your immune system starts creating antibodies (proteins that destroy disease germs). These antibodies stay with you for a long time and remember how to fight off the germ. If the real disease (not the vaccine) enters your body in the future, the antibodies are ready to fight it off before it has a chance to make you sick. Often, your body remembers how to fight a germ for the rest of your life. However, sometimes you need a booster dose of a vaccine to remind your body how to fight off certain germs. Most vaccines need more than one dose over time to produce full protection. That's why it's important to follow the immunization schedule - it gives the best protection with the fewest doses of each vaccine. Vaccines are very effective and much safer than getting the diseases they prevent.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
