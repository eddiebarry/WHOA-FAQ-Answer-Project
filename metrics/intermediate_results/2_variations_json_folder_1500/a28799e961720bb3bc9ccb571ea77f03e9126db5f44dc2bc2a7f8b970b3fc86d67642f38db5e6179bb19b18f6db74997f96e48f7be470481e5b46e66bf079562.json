    "Master Answer": "BC started providing measles vaccine in 1969 and it was recommended for infants at 12 months of age, preschool, and susceptible school children. Adults born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those without a history of measles disease or vaccination should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.\u00a0 Health care workers born in 1957 or later, who do not have evidence of immunity to measles, need two doses of measles-containing vaccine.\u00a0 Health care workers born before 1957 are considered immune to measles. Please call your immunization provider or local public health office if you have further questions.\nImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
