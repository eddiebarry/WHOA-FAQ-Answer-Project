    "Master Answer": "If a person has already been ill with an influenza-like illness this season, it is still recommended that they get the influenza vaccine. This is because the influenza vaccine protects against three or four different influenza viruses, which means even if someone was sick with one influenza virus, the vaccine will still offer protection against two or three other influenza viruses.\u00a0 Vaccination is also important because unless someone tested positive for an influenza virus, they cannot be sure that it was an influenza virus that made them ill as there are other respiratory viruses circulating along with influenza that can cause influenza-like symptoms.\nIf you have questions about whether or not you should receive the influenza vaccine, we recommend that you speak with your immunizing health care provider.\n- Immunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
