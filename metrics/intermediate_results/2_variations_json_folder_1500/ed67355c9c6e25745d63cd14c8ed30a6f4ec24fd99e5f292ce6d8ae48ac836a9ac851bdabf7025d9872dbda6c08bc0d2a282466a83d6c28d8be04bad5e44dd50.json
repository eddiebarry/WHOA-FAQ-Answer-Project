    "Master Answer": "As per Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), there are no data on the safety or effectiveness of the HPV9 vaccine in men 27 years of age and older and therefore, no evidence-based recommendations can be made for the use of the vaccine in this age group.\u00a0 However, the HPV9 vaccine may be given to men 27 years of age and older who are at ongoing risk of exposure to HPV. \u00a0\nMen who have sex with men are at increased risk of HPV-related diseases. For this reason, the HPV vaccine is recommended for men 27 years of age and older who have sex with men, although there are no data on the effectiveness of the HPV9 vaccine in this population.\nWe recommend that you discuss getting vaccinated further with your health care provider.\u00a0\nThe HPV9 vaccine is available for purchase at most pharmacies and travel clinics (the HPV9 vaccine is not provided for free to males in your age group).\nYou can learn more about the HPV9 vaccine on our HPV page.\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
