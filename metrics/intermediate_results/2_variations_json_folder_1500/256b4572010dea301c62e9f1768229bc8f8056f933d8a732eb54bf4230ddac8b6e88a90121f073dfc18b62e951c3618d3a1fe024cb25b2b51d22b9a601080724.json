    "Master Answer": "Nearly all Canadians 50 years of age and older will have had chickenpox, even if it cannot be recalled. Routine serological (blood) testing is not recommended. SHINGRIX\u00ae is indicated for the prevention of shingles in individuals 50 years of age and older with prior chickenpox infection.\u00a0 There is no known safety risk associated with vaccination of healthy individuals who are non-immune to chickenpox with SHINGRIX\u00ae. Learn about the shingles vaccines here.\nIn BC, it is rare for individuals 50 years of age and older to need the chickenpox vaccine. Speak with a public health nurse at your local health unit.
