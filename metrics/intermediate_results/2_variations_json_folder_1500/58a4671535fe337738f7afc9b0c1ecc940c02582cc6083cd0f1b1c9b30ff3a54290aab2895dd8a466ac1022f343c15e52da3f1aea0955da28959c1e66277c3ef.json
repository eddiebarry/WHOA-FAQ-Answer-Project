    "Master Answer": "The sooner a person is immunized, the sooner they have protection. However, it is important that minimum intervals are met (minimum intervals are the shortest time between two doses of a vaccine in a multi-dose series in which a protective response to the next dose can be expected). Please call your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. They will be able to check when the kindergarten entry shots can be safely given. You will find their number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
