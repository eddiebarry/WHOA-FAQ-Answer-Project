    "Master Answer": "The hepatitis B vaccine is provided free to adults at high risk of hepatitis B infection, including students training in a health care profession as they have contact with blood and body fluids in their jobs.\nVaricella (chickenpox) vaccine \u00a0is provided\u00a0free to people 13 years of age or older who have not been immunized. The series is two doses, with the second dose given six weeks after the first dose. Please note:\n\n\t\tPeople who had chickenpox before their first birthday should still get the vaccine. They may not have developed a long-lasting immunity and could get chickenpox again.\n\n\t\tPeople who had chickenpox or shingles disease at one year of age or older do not need to get the vaccine if they had the disease before 2004, or or a lab test confirmed chickenpox.\nPlease speak with your health care provider to review your immunization records and make sure you are up to date. Contact your local health unit.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
