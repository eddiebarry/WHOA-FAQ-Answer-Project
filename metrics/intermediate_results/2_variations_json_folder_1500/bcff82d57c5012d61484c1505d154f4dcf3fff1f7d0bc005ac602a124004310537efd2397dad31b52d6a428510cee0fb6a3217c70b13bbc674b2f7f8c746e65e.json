    "Master Answer": "We recommend that you speak with your immunization provider to see whether another product for Hepatitis A is available.\u00a0 Hepatitis A vaccines may be used interchangeably using the age-appropriate dose for the product being given. Depending on your risk factors and when Havrix will be available it may be an option to wait. Please contact your immunization provider for more information.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "Havrix is not available right now in our area, and I'm due for my 2nd injection at 6 months. Is it ok if I wait? The other option might be to get a Twinrix dose , but then do I need to get 2 Twinrix injections to replace one Havrix dose because there is a smaller dose of Hep A vacc in Twinrix?\n",
