    "Master Answer": "Appointment are usually required to get vaccinated; however, some pharmacies provide vaccines on a walk-in basis.\u00a0\nFind out if you are eligible for the publicly funded (free) HPV vaccine here. If you are eligible for the publicly funded vaccine, you can contact your local health unit to make an appointment to get vaccinated. Some pharmacies and doctors' offices also have the publicly funded vaccine. If you are not eligible for the publicly funded vaccine, you can purchase the vaccine at most pharmacies and travel clinics.\u00a0\nThe HPV9 vaccine (GARDASIL\u00ae9) is used in B.C., not GARDASIL\u00ae. GARDASIL\u00ae9 protects against 5 additional HPV types compared to GARDASIL\u00ae. If you received GARDASIL\u00ae for your first dose, you can complete the series with GARDASIL\u00ae9. A complete series of GARDASIL\u00ae9 is however recommended to ensure protection against the 5 additional HPV types in the vaccine. We recommend that you discuss this further with the health care provider who gives you the vaccine.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
