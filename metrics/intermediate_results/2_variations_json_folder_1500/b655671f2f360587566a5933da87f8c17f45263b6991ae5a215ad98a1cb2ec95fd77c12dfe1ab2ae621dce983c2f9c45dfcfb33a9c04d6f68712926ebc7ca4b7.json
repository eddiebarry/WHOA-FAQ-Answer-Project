    "Master Answer": "The recommended adult schedule for the combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix) is an initial dose followed by doses at 1 month and 6 months. It can also be given in 4 doses, with the initial dose followed by doses at 7 days, 21 to 30 days, and 12 months.\nThe combination hepatitis A and B vaccine provides immunity for at least 10 years and likely for a lifetime when completing the full series. There are currently no recommendations for a healthy person to receive boosters of this combination vaccine if they have completed the full series. Serological testing (blood test) is not recommended before or after immunization. You will find more information about this vaccine here. If you have further questions, we recommend you contact your immunization provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
