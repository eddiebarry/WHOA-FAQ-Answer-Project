    "Master Answer": "We assume that the health report you are referring to is your immunization record. \u00a0If not, please clarify and resubmit your question. \u00a0\nIt is recommended that immunization records are translated into English. This allows for your health care provider in BC to review your record to ensure you have received all of the recommended vaccines. \u00a0Vaccine recommendations differ between countries. \u00a0\nTo ensure accurate translation, it is recommended that you get your record translated at your local public health unit. \u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit\u00a0here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
