    "Master Answer": "If you live in B.C., you can receive publicly funded (free) vaccines that you meet the eligibility criteria for without a card. Publicly funded vaccines are also available from some pharmacies and doctors' offices. However, you may be charged a vaccine administration fee at these places without a B.C. Services Card. If you don't qualify for publicly funded vaccine, it can be purchased at most pharmacies and travel clinics. If you have more questions please contact your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
