    "Master Answer": "Vaccines contain small amounts of specific ingredients, all of which play necessary and important roles.\u00a0The ingredients in vaccines have been carefully studied for a long time, and are safe in the small amounts used in vaccines.\u00a0\nAluminum is used in vaccines as an adjuvant. Adjuvants help improve the immune response to a vaccine (help the vaccine work better). Aluminum has been used safely in vaccines for over 70 years. It is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food, and water. In the first 6 months of life, infants receive more aluminum in their diet than from vaccines.\u00a0 You can read more about vaccine safety and aluminum in vaccines here.\nThimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, is added to influenza vaccines produced in multi-dose vials. It is added to prevent bacterial growth. \u00a0It has been used safely in vaccines for over 80 years.\u00a0Today, all routine childhood vaccines used in B.C. (except certain flu vaccines) are produced in single-dose vials and do not require thimerosal.\u00a0You can read more about vaccine safety and thimerosal in vaccines here.\nYou can find more information on vaccine ingredients here.\u00a0\nIf you have questions or concerns regarding vaccine ingredients or the safety of vaccines, we encourage you to\u00a0 contact your local health unit and ask to speak with your family doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
