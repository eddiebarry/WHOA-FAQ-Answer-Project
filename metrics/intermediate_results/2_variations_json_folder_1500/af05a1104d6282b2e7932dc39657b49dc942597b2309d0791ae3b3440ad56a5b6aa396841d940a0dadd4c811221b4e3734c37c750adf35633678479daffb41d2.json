    "Master Answer": "We do not have a list of vaccines that people would have been offered according to year. There is however a section within the BCCDC Immunization Manual that informs health care providers of which vaccines were recommended when.\nIf you are wondering which vaccines you may have received as a child, your health care provider can consult the manual and give you an indication of which vaccines you may have received. However, without adequate documentation of immunization (an immunization record) or proof of immunity, a person is considered to be unimmunized and unprotected.\nImmunization Nurse\n\t\u00a0\n",
