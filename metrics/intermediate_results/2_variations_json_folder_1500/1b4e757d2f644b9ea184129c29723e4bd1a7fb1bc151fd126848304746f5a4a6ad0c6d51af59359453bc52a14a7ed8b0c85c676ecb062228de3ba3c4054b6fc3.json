    "Master Answer": "It is recommended that parents or guardians and their children discuss consent for immunization. Efforts are first made to seek parental/guardian or representative consent prior to immunization. However, children under the age of 19, who are able to understand the benefits and possible reactions for each vaccine and the risk of not getting immunized, can legally consent to or refuse immunizations.\u00a0 In B.C. mature minor consent may be used for grade 9 vaccinations. We recommend that you call your local community health centre and ask to speak to a public health nurse if you have concerns. You can find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
