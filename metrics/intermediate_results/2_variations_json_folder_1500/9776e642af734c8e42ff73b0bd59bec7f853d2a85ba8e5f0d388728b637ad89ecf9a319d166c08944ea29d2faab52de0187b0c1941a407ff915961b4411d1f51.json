    "Master Answer": "Those born after 1970 who are not fully immunized with two doses of a measles vaccine, and who have not had measles disease in the past, should receive a dose of measles mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. In Vancouver, contact your local community health centre, (which includes the West Vancouver Location) or the City Centre Urgent Primary Care Centre. Your family doctor and your pharmacist (for adults and kids over five) may also have the vaccine available. Please call ahead to ensure vaccine is available. A list of locations confirmed to have MMR vaccine for administration as of February 22nd is on the VCH website.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
