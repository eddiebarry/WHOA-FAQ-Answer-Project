The vaccine should not be given to those who currently have shingles. Read more about shingles here.\nBC's immunization schedules have two pneumococcal vaccines for various ages and/or health conditions. These vaccines may be publicly funded (free) or available for purchase from a pharmacy or travel health clinics. Services vary across BC. There is not a specific time frame between shingles disease and a pneumococcal vaccine. Please discuss with your health care provider your current health and when to schedule your next vaccine(s).\n\n\t\tPneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine\u00a0(Prevnar\u00ae 13, PCV-13)-Schedule this vaccine first before PPSV-23\n\n\t\tPneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Pneumovax\u00ae 23, PPSV-23\u20ac\u017d)-Schedule at least 8 weeks after PCV-13\nImmunization Nurse\n",
