The influenza vaccine and\u00a0Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine\u00a0are part of the routine immunization program in BC. These vaccines may be recommended for you depending on your age, job, lifestyle, health conditions, travel plans and the vaccines you received in the past. Vaccines are available from most pharmacies, some doctors' offices and local health units. Use the health unit finder to talk with a nurse and book an appointment.\nA booster dose of the\u00a0Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine\u00a0is recommended for adults who were immunized in childhood but is not provided for free in BC. Most adults have to purchase the Tdap vaccine from their local pharmacy, doctor's office or travel health clinic.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
