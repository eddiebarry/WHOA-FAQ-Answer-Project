    "Master Answer": "The chickenpox vaccine was introduced in BC in 2002. A blood test for chickenpox (varicella) is not recommended if you had the vaccine.\nAdults with two documented doses of the chickenpox vaccine, do not need any further doses of vaccine. Adults who have had chickenpox or shingles (herpes zoster) after 12 months of age are also considered immune and do not need the vaccine.
