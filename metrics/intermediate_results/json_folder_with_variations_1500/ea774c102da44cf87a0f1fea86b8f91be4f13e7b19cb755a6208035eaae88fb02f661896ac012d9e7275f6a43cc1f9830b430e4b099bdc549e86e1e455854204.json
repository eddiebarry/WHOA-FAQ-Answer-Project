    "Master Answer": "In B.C. there is no set age when a child is considered capable to give consent. It is recommended that parents or guardians and their children discuss consent for vaccination. Efforts are first made to seek parental/guardian or representative consent prior to vaccination. However, children under the age of 19, who are able to understand the benefits and possible reactions for each vaccine and the risk of not getting immunized, can legally consent to or refuse vaccinations.\u00a0\nYou will find more information here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
