    "Master Answer": "In BC, tetanus is provided in the Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Polio (Tdap-IPV) vaccine, given as a one dose to children 4-6 years of age. This booster dose strengthens the immune system to give children better protection against these diseases. You can learn more about this vaccine here.\nCombination vaccines are safe. Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into a single injection, so that children can get protection against several diseases with just one shot. You can learn more about vaccine safety here.\nIf you have questions about the Tdap-IPV vaccine or the safety of combination vaccines for your child, speaking with your immunizing healthcare provider.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
