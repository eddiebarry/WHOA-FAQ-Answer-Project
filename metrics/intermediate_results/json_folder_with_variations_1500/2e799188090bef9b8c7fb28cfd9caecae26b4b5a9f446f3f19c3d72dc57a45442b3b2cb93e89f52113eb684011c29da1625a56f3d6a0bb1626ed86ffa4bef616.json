    "Master Answer": "We assume your daughter is a student of a health care profession and was tested to determine her protective status for hepatitis B. \u00a0As per the BCCDC immunization guidelines, if a student of a health care profession has an anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) level of < 10IU/L, but detectable, one dose of the vaccine should be given and then a retest should be done. If the retest shows an anti-HBs level of \u2030\u00a5 10IU/L, no more doses are needed. However if the level is still < 10IU/L, the second vaccine series should be completed and another retest done.\nWe recommend that your daughter follows up with her health care provider who can make a recommendation for her and provide her with more information.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
