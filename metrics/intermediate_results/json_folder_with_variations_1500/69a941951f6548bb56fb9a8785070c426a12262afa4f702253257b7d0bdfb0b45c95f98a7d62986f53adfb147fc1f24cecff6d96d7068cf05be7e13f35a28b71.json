    "Master Answer": "There is no need to purchase private insurance for the routine schedule for infants and children. All vaccines recommended on the routine schedule are publicly funded (free) and are covered by MSP. You can find the routine schedule for infants and children here.\u00a0 Vaccines required for travel that are outside of the routine schedule are not publicly funded and can be purchased and given at a travel clinic. Some private health care plans will cover the cost of travel vaccines. It is up to people to check with their health plan to see what travel vaccines may be covered. If you have further questions regarding vaccinations, we recommend you call your local community health centre and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
