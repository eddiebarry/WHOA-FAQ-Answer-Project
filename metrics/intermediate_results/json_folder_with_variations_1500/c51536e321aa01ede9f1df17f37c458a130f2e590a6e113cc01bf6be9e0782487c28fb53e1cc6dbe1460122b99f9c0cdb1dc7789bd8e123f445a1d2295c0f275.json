    "Master Answer": "Your baby should be fine. For best protection against disease, it's advised that children get vaccinated starting at 2 months of age and that they follow the recommended schedule as closely as possible. We recommend that you make an appointment for the 2nd set of vaccines when you see your doctor. If getting an appointment is a problem, you can also contact your local health unit. You will find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
