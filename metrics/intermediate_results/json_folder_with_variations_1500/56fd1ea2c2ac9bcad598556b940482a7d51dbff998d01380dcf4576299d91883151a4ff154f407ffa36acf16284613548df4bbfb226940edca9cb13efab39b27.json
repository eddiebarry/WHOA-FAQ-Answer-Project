    "Master Answer": "Yes, this is possible. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is available on it's own. \u00a0We encourage you to discuss this further with your immunizing health care provider.\u00a0\nThe MMR vaccine is given to children as a series of 2 doses. The first dose is given at 12 months of age. As of January 1, 2012, the second dose of the vaccine was moved from 18 months of age to 4 to 6 years of age. For children who also need protection against chickenpox (varicella), the 2nd dose of vaccine can be given as the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine.\u00a0\n",
