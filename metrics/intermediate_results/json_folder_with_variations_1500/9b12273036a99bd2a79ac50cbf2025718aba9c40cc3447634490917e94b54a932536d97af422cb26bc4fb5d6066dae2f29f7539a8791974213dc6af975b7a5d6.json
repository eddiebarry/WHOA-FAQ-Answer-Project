    "Master Answer": "For optimal immune response, it is always best to stick to the recommended schedule. However, vaccines can be given at what we refer to as a \u20ac\u0153minimum interval\u20ac\u009d which is the shortest time between two doses of a vaccine in a multi-dose series in which a protective response to the subsequent dose could be expected. The 2nd dose of Hep B can be given as soon as 4 weeks after the 1st dose. The 3rd dose should be given at least 8 weeks after the 2nd, and 16 weeks after the 1st. Please speak with your immunization provider to discuss your Hep B vaccine schedule.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
