    "Master Answer": "If you are referring to influenza (flu) vaccine, here is some information you may be interested in. The publicly funded (free) influenza vaccine is purchased by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with money allocated by the Ministry of Health and is distributed through the local health authorities.\u00a0 The provincial supply of the publicly funded influenza vaccine is determined prior to the actual influenza season based on information from each of the health authorities.\u00a0 Thus, each health authority receives a pre-determined amount of the publicly-funded vaccine.\nDepending on the particular demand in a given year, in a specific area or at a specific location, sometimes select clinics may run out of the publicly funded vaccine. The publicly funded vaccine is available from a variety of vaccine providers, including public health clinics, pharmacies, travel clinics and some doctors' offices.\nPlease use our Flu Finder to find other clinics near you.\nImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
