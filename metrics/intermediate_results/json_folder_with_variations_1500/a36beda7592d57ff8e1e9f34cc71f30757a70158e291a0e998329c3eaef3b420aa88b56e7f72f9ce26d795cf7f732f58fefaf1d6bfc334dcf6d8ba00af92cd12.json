    "Master Answer": "There are several vaccines that adults are eligible for free of charge if they were not immunized as children.\nAdults who were not adequately immunized as children may be at risk of infection from a number of vaccine-preventable diseases. This schedule lists all the vaccines that are routinely recommended and provided free in BC to adults who are 18 years of age or older and who were not immunized in childhood: BC Adult Immunization Schedule.\nAdult immunizations are available by appointment from some public health units in BC. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\nA number of pharmacists in BC also provide immunizations. It's best to call ahead to confirm vaccine availability. Immunizations may also be available from your family doctor.\nFor more information on adult immunizations, visit our adult immunizations page here. \u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
