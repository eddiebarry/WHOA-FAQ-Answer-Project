    "Master Answer": "ImmunizeBC does not have access to your child's immunization records. If you need a copy of your child's immunization records, there are several places you can look:\n\n\t\tCheck your home for your child's paper record of immunizations.\u00a0 Try looking through baby books or other saved documents.\u00a0 In BC, childhood immunizations are most often recorded in the Child Health Passport.\n\n\t\tCheck with your local public health unit if your child was immunized at the health unit or in school. Public health units in BC maintain an electronic registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health nurses.\n\n\t\tCheck with your daughter's doctor for vaccines provided at the doctor's office.\nPeople without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected. These people should generally\u00a0be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.\u00a0 It is safe to repeat vaccines.\u00a0 People can also have their blood tested for antibodies to determine their immunity to certain diseases. Your child's health care provider can help you determine what is best for your child. \u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
