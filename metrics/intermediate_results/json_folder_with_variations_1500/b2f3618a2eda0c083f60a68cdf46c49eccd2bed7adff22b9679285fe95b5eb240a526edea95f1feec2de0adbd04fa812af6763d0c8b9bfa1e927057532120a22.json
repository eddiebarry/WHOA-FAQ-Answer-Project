    "Master Answer": "If you are asking how much time should elapse between doses of TWINRIX\u00ae the recommended TWINRIX\u00ae dosing schedule consists of 3 vaccine doses over the course of 6 months, with the second and third doses given at one month and six months following the first dose. To help ensure adequate protection against hepatitis A and B, make sure you complete all 3 vaccine doses. Sometimes when people are about to travel and have less time, a rapid dose schedule is used. It may be given in 4 doses, with the initial dose followed by doses at 7 days, 21 to 30 days, and 12 months. Interruption of a recommended vaccine series of Twinrix does not require starting the series over again, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. If you have other questions, please contact your immunization provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
