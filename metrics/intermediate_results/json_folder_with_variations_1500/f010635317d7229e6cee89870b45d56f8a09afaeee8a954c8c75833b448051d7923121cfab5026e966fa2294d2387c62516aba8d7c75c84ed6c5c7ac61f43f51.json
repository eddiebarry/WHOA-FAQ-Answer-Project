    "Master Answer": "Immune response to vaccine depends on several factors such as type of vaccine given and age and health of the person getting the vaccine. Some vaccines require one or two doses for full immunity, others require several doses over several years for ongoing protection. It is not typically recommended that titers be checked for children to ensure they are protected. We recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. The public health nurse will have access to a BC Centre for Disease Control document which outlines vaccine Immunogenicity, efficacy, and effectiveness and it will give you the chance to ask other questions you may have. You can find the number for your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
