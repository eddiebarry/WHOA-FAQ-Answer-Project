    "Master Answer": "Unfortunately, we don't know the exact package insert you read and cannot comment regarding the manufacturer's document. However, inactivated vaccines, such as Tdap (Adacel), are generally considered safe in pregnancy.\n\tA number of studies in recent years have shown that the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine is safe when given in pregnancy and is effective in preventing whooping cough (pertussis) in newborns. After careful review of these studies, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended that all pregnant women get the pertussis vaccine to help protect the baby after birth. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada also recommends that all pregnant women get the pertussis vaccine.\n\tThe pertussis vaccine is recommended for pregnant women in many countries, including the U.S, Australia, and New Zealand.\nYou can find more information on vaccines and pregnancy here.\n\t\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",
