    "Master Answer": "Not all immunization providers can immunize young children in their scope of practice. For example, pharmacists immunize children 5 years of age and older with injectable flu vaccine. It may be that some clinics are not in an environment conducive to immunizing children or may not be adequately staffed. You can use ImmunizeBC's Influenza (Flu) Clinic Locator to find information on flu clinics in your area.\u00a0 Children can usually get immunized at public health clinics (listed as \"Public Health Unit\" in the Locator), however we suggest that you contact the your local health unit to confirm that this is the case in your area.\u00a0 Please ask to speak to a public health nurse who can explore what some of your options are.\u00a0 You can find your local public health clinic here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
