    "Master Answer": "Immunocompromised individuals may not be able to mount a strong immune system response to vaccines but are at particular risk of infection with some bacterias (germs) that are vaccine preventable. Health care providers follow specific\u00a0schedules and vaccine recommendations for those who are immunocompromised. Some immunocompromised individuals may not be able to receive live vaccines except when approved by their primary care provider or specialist. Read about vaccine safety.\nDiscuss with your health care provider your current health conditions and which vaccines are recommended for you. You can get publicly-funded (free) vaccines from your local health unit, most pharmacies, and some doctors' offices. You can purchase non-publicly funded vaccines at most pharmacies and travel clinics. Services vary throughout B.C.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
