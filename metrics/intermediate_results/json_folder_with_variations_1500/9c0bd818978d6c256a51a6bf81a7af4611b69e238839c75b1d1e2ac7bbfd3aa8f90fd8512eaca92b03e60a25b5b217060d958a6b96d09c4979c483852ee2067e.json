    "Master Answer": "The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends the Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) for adults with medical conditions resulting in high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. Discuss your medical conditions and the PCV 13 with your health care provider to determine if you are eligible for publicly funded (free) vaccine.\nThe PCV 13 vaccine should be administered at least one year after any previous dose of Pneumococcal Polysaccharide vaccine. If you are not eligible for free PCV 13 vaccine, it is available for purchase from pharmacies and travel health clinics. We recommend that you call your local pharmacy for the price. You can find more information about pneumococcal vaccines here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
