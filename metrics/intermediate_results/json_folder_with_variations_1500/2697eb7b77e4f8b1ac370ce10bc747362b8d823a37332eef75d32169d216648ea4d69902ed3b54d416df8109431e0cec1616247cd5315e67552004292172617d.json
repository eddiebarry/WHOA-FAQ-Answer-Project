There may be susceptible people in this age group, however, and those who have not had measles disease or the vaccine should get 1 dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\u00a0 However, the recommendations for travel may be different.\u00a0\nWe do not provide travel vaccine recommendations at ImmunizeBC. Please contact your local travel clinic to have your immunization record reviewed and vaccines recommended for your destination.
