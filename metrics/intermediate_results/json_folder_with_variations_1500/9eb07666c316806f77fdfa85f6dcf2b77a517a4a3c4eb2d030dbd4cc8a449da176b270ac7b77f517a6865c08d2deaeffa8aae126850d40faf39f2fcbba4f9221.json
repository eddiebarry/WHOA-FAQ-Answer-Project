    "Master Answer": "As a BC resident, your baby can receive vaccines if temporarily living in another part of Canada. However, the\u00a0Ontario immunization schedule is different, so bring your baby's BC vaccine records to the appointment. Also, if/when you return to BC ask a nurse at your local health unit to review your baby's vaccine records as they may require additional vaccines/doses. In BC, use the health unit finder to book an immunization appointment.\n\tImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
