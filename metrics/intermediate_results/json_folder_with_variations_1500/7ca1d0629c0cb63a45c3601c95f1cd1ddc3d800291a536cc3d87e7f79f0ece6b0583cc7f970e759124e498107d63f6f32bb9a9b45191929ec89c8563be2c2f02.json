    "Master Answer": "For children under 4 years of age who have received one dose of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine, the second dose is given at 4 \u20ac\u201c 6 years of age. In BC, there is no change to the routine MMR vaccine schedule and there is not a recommendation for your child to receive a MMR vaccine early. The efficacy (vaccine's ability to prevent illness in research studies) of a single dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%.\nHowever, if you are travelling overseas to an area with high rates of measles, an early second dose is recommended prior to travel. This dose can be given as early as 4 weeks after the first dose. To receive vaccines related to travel, contact a travel health clinic.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
