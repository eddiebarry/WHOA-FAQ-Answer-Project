    "Master Answer": "Most people who get shingles will get better and will not get it again. But it is possible to get shingles more than once. SHINGRIX\u00ae is recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (but not provided free in BC) for people 50 years of age and older, including those who have had a previous episode of shingles.\nAs you are\u00a0 younger than 50 years of age, please speak with your health care provider. The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has not been studied in individuals younger than 50 years of age and this would be considered off-label use.\nFor more information on shingles, check here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
