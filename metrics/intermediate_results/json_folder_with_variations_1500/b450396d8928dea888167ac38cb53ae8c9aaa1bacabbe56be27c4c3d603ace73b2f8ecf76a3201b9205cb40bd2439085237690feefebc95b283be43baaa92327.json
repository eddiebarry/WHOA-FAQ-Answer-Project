    "Master Answer": "Vaccine recommendations and schedules\u00a0differ between countries. It is important that you bring copies of your children's immunization records with you to Canada. There is no specific form but the record should include at least the name of the vaccines and dates they were given. It is helpful, but not essential that the English translation of the vaccine is available. You can take their immunization records to your local public health unit in Vancouver to be checked.\u00a0A public health nurse can review your children's records and recommend and provide any missing vaccines. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here. \nYou can find a list of vaccines recommended for children and adults in BC here:\u00a0\u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/vaccine-schedules.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
