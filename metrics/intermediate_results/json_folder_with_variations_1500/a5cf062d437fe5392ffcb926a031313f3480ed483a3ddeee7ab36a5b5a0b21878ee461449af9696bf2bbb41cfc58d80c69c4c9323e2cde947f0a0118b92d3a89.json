    "Master Answer": "Chickenpox is not a reportable communicable disease in BC. A child with chickenpox after the age of one (that was confirmed by a lab test) is considered immune against chickenpox and doesn't need a second dose of the vaccine. If your daughter had her chickenpox confirmed by a lab test, contact your healthcare provider to have it noted in her immunization record.\nChickenpox vaccine is not 100% effective, but a single dose of the vaccine prevents 95% of severe chickenpox disease. Chickenpox infection (more than 42 days after vaccination) is called vaccine modified disease.\u00a0 Individuals who develop chickenpox after vaccination usually have milder disease.
