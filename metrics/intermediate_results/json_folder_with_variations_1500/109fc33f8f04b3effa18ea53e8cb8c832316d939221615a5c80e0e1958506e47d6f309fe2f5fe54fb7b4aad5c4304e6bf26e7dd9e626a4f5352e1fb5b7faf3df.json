    "Master Answer": "Most children in grade 6 will have been immunized against hepatitis B infection at a younger age. If a child has previously received 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine at a younger age, they do not need the vaccine in grade 6.\u00a0\nVaccine recommendations and schedules\u00a0differ between countries. It's advised that you take your son's immunization record to your local public health unit to be checked.\u00a0A public health nurse can review your son's record and recommend and provide any missing vaccines. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\nYou can find more information on grade 6 immunizations in BC here.\u00a0\nYou referred to \"Hib catch up\" in your question. \u00a0If this was not a typo and you have quesitons about the\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0type B (Hib) vaccine, please submit another question.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
