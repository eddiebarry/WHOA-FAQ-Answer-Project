    "Master Answer": "The\u00a0hepatitis A vaccine is recommended and provided free to people at high risk of hepatitis A infection.\u00a0 It is also recommended, but not provided free, for people likely to come in contact with or spread the hepatitis A virus, including food handlers. \u00a0For more informaiton about hepatitis A and the vaccine, including a list of people eligible for the free vaccine, see the HealthLink BC File:\u00a0Hepatitis A Vaccine.\u00a0\n\n\tYou would not be eligible for the free hepatitis A vaccine based solely on the criteria you have provided. However, you may be eligible based on other criteria. For this reason, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse who can assess your situation further and tell you whether or not you are eligible for the free vaccine. Anyone not eligible for the free hepatitis A vaccine can purchase it at most pharmacies and travel clinics. \u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tA public health nurse can also provide you with information regarding any other vaccines that may be recommended for you. \u00a0For example, the hepatitis B vaccine is recommended and provided free to people born in 1980 and later and to people at high risk of hepatitis B infection, including people who have contact with blood and body fluids in their jobs/volunteer work.\u00a0\n",
