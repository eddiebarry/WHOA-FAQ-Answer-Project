    "Master Answer": "In BC, immunizing health care providers ask if your child has any allergies to make sure there are no contraindications for your child with the recommended vaccines. Disclose that your child has allergies when speaking with the immunizing health care provider. A health care provider can go over the routine BC immunization schedule, which vaccines are included and their ingredients.\u00a0For a complete list of all the ingredients in vaccines in Canada, please go here. Contact your local health unit. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
