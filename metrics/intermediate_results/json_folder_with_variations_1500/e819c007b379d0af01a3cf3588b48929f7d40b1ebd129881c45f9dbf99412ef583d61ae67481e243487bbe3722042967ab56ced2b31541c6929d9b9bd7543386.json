    "Master Answer": "The HPV vaccine is recommended for adult women up to 45 years of age.\u00a0 Women may be immunized even if they have had a known HPV infection or have had previous Pap abnormalities (including cervical cancer).\u00a0 Women who have had a known HPV infection will benefit from receiving the vaccine for the HPV types for which they have not been exposed.\u00a0 The likelihood of having been exposed to all types of HPV contained in the vaccine is low (the HPV9 vaccine protects against 9 different types of HPV). HPV vaccines do not treat infections.\u00a0\nThe nurses at ImmunizeBC only provide general information about immunization and do not provide individual consults. \u00a0It is recommended that the woman you are referring to follows up with her health care provider who can make an individual recommendation for her. \u00a0\nYou can find more information on HPV vaccines on our HPV page.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
