    "Master Answer": "If you do not have a copy of your child's immunization record, you can try to get your child's record sent to you from India.\nIf you are able to get your child's record sent to you, it is recommended that you take it to your local public health unit to be checked (routine childhood immunizations may be different in India than in BC). \u00a0A public health nurse can recommend and provide any missing routine vaccines for free.\nIf you are not able to locate your child's record, a public health nurse can discuss your options with you. \u00a0Without a record of immunization, a child is considered unimmunized and unprotected.\u00a0 Any missing routine vaccines will be offered for free to ensure best protection.\u00a0\nYou can find the contact information for your local public health unit here: \u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/finder.\u00a0\n",
