    "Master Answer": "In some areas of BC, parents are asked to submit their children's immunization records to the school. \u00a0After the immunization record has been given to your school it is reviewed by your school's Public Health Nurse and the information is entered into your child's health record at your public health unit. All of the information is confidential. This ensures the right vaccines are recommended for your child in the future. School Medical Health Officers also need these records for decisions should someone have a vaccine preventable disease at your school.\u00a0\nFor more information, please contact your local public health unit.\u00a0\n",
