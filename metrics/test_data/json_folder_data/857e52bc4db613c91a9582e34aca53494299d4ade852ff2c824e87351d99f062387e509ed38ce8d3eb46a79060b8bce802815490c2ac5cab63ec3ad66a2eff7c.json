    "Master Answer": "\nThe chickenpox vaccine is provided to students in grade 6 who have not received 2 doses of the vaccine. Most grade 6 students would have received 1 dose of the chickenpox vaccine on or shortly after their 1st birthday and will only need 1 more dose of the vaccine. Grade 6 students who have never received the vaccine should get 2 doses at least 3 months apart.\nIf you have questions about how to fill out the consent form, we encourage you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with your child's school nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here:\u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/finder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more information on grade 6 immunizations, please see the HealthLinkBC File: Grade 6 Immunizations in BC. \u00a0\n",
