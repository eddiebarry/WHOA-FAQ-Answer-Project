    "Master Answer": "Some vaccines are made from live germs or toxins, which need to be killed or made inactive so they do not cause disease. \u00a0Formaldehyde is used to do this, and then it is diluted during the vaccine manufacturing process. \u00a0Residual quantities of formaldehyde may be found in some vaccines, however this tiny amount does not pose a safety concern.\u00a0\nFormaldehyde is naturally occurring in the human body and helps with metabolism.\u00a0 There is approximately 10 times the amount of formaldehyde in a baby's body at any one time than there is in a vaccine. Humans break down formaldehyde quickly, so it does not build up in the body.\nVaccines are made with ingredients that make them safe and effective.\u00a0 If you have questions or concerns regarding any of the ingredients in vaccines, we encourage you to talk to a public health nurse or your primary health care provider.\n\u00a0\n",
