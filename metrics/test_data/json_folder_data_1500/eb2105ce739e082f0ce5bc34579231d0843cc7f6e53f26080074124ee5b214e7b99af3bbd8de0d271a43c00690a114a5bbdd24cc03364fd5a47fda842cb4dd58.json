    "Master Answer": "BC residents may purchase a variety of vaccines (most vaccines do not need a prescription) and pay to have these vaccines administered by an authorized pharmacist. Vaccine costs, including administration supplies and services, are paid for by individuals (out of pocket). Selected private drug plans may also cover vaccine costs.\nContact your local pharmacy and ask if the pharmacist is authorized to give vaccines, including the Twinrix\u00ae (combined hepatitis A & B vaccine). Need help finding a pharmacist authorized to give vaccines? You can contact the BC Pharmacy Association at info@bcpharmacy.ca.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
