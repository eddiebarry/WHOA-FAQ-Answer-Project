    "Master Answer": "ImmunizeBC does not have information about online booking systems. The issue you are experiencing could be temporary and related to the time of year. Health units throughout BC are experiencing high call volumes. If you are calling a central immunization booking line, an alternative would be to contact the health unit your family is immunized at directly. Use the health unit finder. Visiting the clinic is also an alternative.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
