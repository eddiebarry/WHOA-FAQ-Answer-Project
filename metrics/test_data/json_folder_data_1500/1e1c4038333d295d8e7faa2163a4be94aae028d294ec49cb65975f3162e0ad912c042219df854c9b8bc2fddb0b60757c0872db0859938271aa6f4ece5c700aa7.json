    "Master Answer": "Some vaccines are publicly funded (free) for adults and others are not. For example, a booster dose of the tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccine is recommended for adults every 10 years and is free. Please call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse who can do a further assesmment of what vaccines you may need and advise what vaccines are publicly funded and tell you about others that may be recommended but are not free. You can find the number for your local public health unit here. You can also find more info about adult vaccines here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
