    "Master Answer": "While vaccinations are highly effective, and greatly decrease the chance of contracting preventable diseases, no vaccine is 100% effective. Depending on the vaccine, about 1% to 5% of children who are vaccinated fail to develop immunity. If these children are exposed to that disease, they could get sick. So your child would be at risk of getting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child if the unvaccinated child were to catch that disease.\nAlso, infants and young children are at higher risk of serious illness if they catch a vaccine-preventable disease due to their immature immune systems and physical development.\u00a0 Once a child has received all of their immunizations, their risk of getting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child (or adult) decreases.\u00a0 There may be many instances in which your child may be in an environment in which there may be people who are not immunized.\u00a0 It is important to weigh the risks and benefits in making the decision as to whether you want your child to be in that environment.\u00a0 We encourage you to discuss this further with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse. You will find the phone number for your health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
