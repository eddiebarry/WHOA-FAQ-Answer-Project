    "Master Answer": "In BC, there are 2 live vaccines that you may have received in the past where scab would form after vaccine adminstration and leave a scar at the adminstration site.\u00a0\nSmallpox [Vaccinia] Vaccine: After smallpox was eliminated from the world, routine vaccination against smallpox was stopped because it was no longer needed.\u00a0 In BC, we stopped giving smallpox vaccine in 1980. The smallpox vaccine was given by a special technique that caused a blister which formed a scab and when the scab fell off, it left a scar (usually in the deltoid area of the upper arm).\nBacille Calmette-Gu\u00c3\u00a9rin (BCG) Vaccine: The BCG vaccine is not currently recommended for routine use in any Canadian population. In BC, the BCG vaccine was discontinued for health care workers in the 1970s and in 2003 the program was discontinued in BC First Nations communities.The BCG vaccine is given intradermally (under the superficial layers of the skin) that forms a papule (small raised swelling) or ulceration (sore on the skin in 50% of people) that leads to a scar (usually in the deltoid area of the upper arm).\nImmunization Nurse\n",
