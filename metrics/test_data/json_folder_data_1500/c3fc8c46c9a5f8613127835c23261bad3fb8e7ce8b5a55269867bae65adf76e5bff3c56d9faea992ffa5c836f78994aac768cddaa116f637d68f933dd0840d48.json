    "Master Answer": "Tdap vaccine is not licensed for use in 3 year olds and the tetanus vaccine is not available on its own. It is combined with other vaccines so children can receive protection from several diseases with one shot. We recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. Public health nurses are available to answer any immunization questions you may have and they can review what the schedule for an unimmunized 3 year old would be.\u00a0 You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\n",
    "Master Question": "Hi, what would be the Tdap vaccine schedule for a 3 year old who has never received any vaccinations previously? Is it possible to buy single dose tetanus vaccine instead? Thx\n",
