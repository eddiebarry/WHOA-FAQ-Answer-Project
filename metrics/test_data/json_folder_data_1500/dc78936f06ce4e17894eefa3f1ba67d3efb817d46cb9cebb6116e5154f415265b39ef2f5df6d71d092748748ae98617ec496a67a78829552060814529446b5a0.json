    "Master Answer": "If possible, it's advised that you attempt to obtain your son's immunization records from your previous health care provider. \u00a0You can find tips on locating immunization records here. \u00a0 \nA child without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity, is considered unimmunized and unprotected. \u00a0In general, it is advised that children without written documentation of immunization get immunized according to the schedule for their current age. \u00a0Getting extra doses of vaccine is not harmful and ensures protection. We recommend that you discuss this further with your public health nurse or doctor.\u00a0\nIt's also advised that you take your son's immunization record (even if it is incomplete) to your local public health unit to be checked. Vaccine recommendations and schedules\u00a0differ between countries. \u00a0A public health nurse can review your son's record and recommend and provide any missing vaccines. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\n",
    "Master Question": "I don't have my son's updated or correct record of immunization from India, should I get him vaccinated for Hep B again?
