    "Master Answer": "Yes, your daughter should be able to get her 2nd dose here if she is due. Vaccine schedules vary from location to location. Here in BC the first dose of chicken pox is given at 12 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Children 4 - 12 years of age who also need protection against measles, mumps or rubella can get their second dose of the chickenpox vaccine as the combined Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (MMRV) vaccine.\u00a0 If you would like more information, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. Please have your daughter's immunization record handy when you speak with the public health nurse. You will find the number for the local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
