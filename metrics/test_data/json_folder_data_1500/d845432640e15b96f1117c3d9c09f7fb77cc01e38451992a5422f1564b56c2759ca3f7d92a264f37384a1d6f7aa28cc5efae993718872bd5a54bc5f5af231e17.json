    "Master Answer": "Evenings and weekends may be available at your local health unit. Please contact them directly around vaccine appointment times/days as services vary across BC. Use the Health Unit Finder. Depending on where you live, your local doctor's office may also provide vaccines. In addition, most pharmacies provide vaccines for children 5 years of age and older.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
