    "Master Answer": "MMR vaccine is part of the publicly-funded (free) immunization program in BC and a prescription is not required.\u00a0\n\n\t\tFor all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (given as MMR in Canada) are recommended. Individuals born in 1970 or later with documentation of two doses of a measles-containing vaccine are considered immune and no booster doses are recommended.\n\n\t\tIndividuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals.\nLearn more about measles and the MMR vaccine here.\u00a0\nIn BC, many health professions are authorized to immunize including nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physicians and naturopathic doctors. Contact the clinic of your choice to inquire if they provide immunizations. In BC, all health units provide immunizations. Use the health unit finder.\u00a0\nPlease note: some health care providers in BC may charge a fee with immunization services and some health care providers in BC do not give immunizations to children under 5 years of age.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
