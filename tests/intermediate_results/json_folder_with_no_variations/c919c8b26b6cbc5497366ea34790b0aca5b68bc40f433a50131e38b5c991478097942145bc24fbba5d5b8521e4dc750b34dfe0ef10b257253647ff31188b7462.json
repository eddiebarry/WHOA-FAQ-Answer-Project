For information on pertussis cases in your area, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit.\nLocal public health officials monitor disease trends in their area and determine if (and when) an outbreak should be declared. If declared, the outbreak and recommendations are communicated to the public.\u00a0\nIf you have further questions about pertussis or about the Tdap vaccine, we recommend that you speak with a public health nurse of your family doctor.
