    "Master Answer": "Considerations around travel with a baby are challenging.\n\n\t\tAlthough your baby is too young for measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, you can protect your baby agaisnt many other vaccine preventable diseases with the BC routine immunization schedule.\n\n\t\tDuring pregnancy, a woman who is immune to measles from past vaccination or measles disease, shares her measles antibodies (IgG) through the placenta to her developing baby. After birth, the amount of measles antibodies the baby has and how long they last for vary depending on the woman's level of measles antibodies, whether the baby was born premature etc.\n\n\t\tFor further questions about measles risk and protection for your baby, please speak with your health care provider.\n\n\t\tYou can also speak with a nurse at your local health unit to ask questions about vaccines and book the 2 and 4 month vaccine appointments. Use the Health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
