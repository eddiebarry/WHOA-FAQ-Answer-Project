Find out which vaccines may be recommended or required for your destination here.\nIn BC, travel vaccines are available from travel health clinics, most pharmacies and some doctors' offices. There is a charge for most travel vaccines.\nConsult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic\u00a0 as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before you travel and ask about the tavel vaccines. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
