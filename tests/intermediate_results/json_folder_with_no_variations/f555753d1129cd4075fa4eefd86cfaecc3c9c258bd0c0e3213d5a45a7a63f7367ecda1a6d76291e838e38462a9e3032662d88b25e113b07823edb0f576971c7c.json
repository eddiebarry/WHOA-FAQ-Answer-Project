    "Master Answer": "You do not have to wait any period of time between receipt of the Shingrix\u00ae vaccine and an influenza vaccine (flu shot).\nVaccine safety is important. Reporting potential side effects (adverse events following immunization) is a part of BC and Canada's vaccine safety monitoring process. Contact the\u00a0 health care professional that provided the Shingrix\u00ae vaccine directly. Potential side effects after a vaccine can also be reported to your local health unit. Our health unit finder is\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0If you have questions about your health, you can also speak with a nurse at HealthLinkBC by calling 8-1-1.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
