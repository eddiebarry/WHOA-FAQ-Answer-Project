    "Master Answer": "Vaccines have to be kept in refrigeration conditions (between 2-8 degrees Celsius) so vaccines cannot be mailed. The chickenpox & meningococcal-c-c vaccines cannot be picked up by your friend as the health care provider will only give the vaccines to your son in the clinic. For rotavirus vaccine, the maximum age for last dose is 8 months, so your son is no longer eligible.\nBook an immunization appointment upon your return to Canada for any of the vaccines you are not able to get in your current location.\u00a0In BC, vaccines for infants are given at the local health unit or Doctor's office. Find your health unit here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
