    "Master Answer": "You can discuss with your daughter that after one dose of chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, 97% of children develop protection against chickenpox. After the second dose, 99% of children develop protection against chickenpox. To learn more about chickenpox, go here.\nIf a person who has never had chickenpox/vaccine comes in direct contact with a shingles (zoster) rash, the shingles virus could be transmitted and that person could develop chickenpox.\u00a0 People with shingles can\u00a0 help protect others by keeping their lesions covered,\u00a0 washing their hands after touching their lesions and avoiding close contact with those who are not immune to chickenpox. To learn more shingles, go here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "Can you catch chickenpox from someone suffering from shingles? My daughter had only 1 of the 2 vaccinations for chicken pox previously and is scared. Should she avoid the person who has shingles?\n",
