    "Master Answer": "If you are now a resident of BC, you can receive publicly funded (free) vaccines that you meet the eligibility criteria for. Read about recommended vaccines for adults here. As you do not yet have MSP coverage, book immunizations at your local health unit. Use the health unit finder. Publicly funded vaccines are also available from some pharmacies and doctors' offices. However, you may be charged a vaccine administration fee in these settings without MSP.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
