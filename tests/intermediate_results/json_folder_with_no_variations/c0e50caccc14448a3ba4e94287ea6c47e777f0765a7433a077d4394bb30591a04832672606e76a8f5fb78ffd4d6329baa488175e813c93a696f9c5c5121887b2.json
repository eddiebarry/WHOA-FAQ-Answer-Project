    "Master Answer": "Common reactions to the vaccine may include soreness, redness and swelling where the vaccine was given. Headache, muscle soreness, chills, fever, and nausea may also occur after getting the vaccine. These reactions are mild and generally last 1 to 2 days. After a vaccine, pain and swelling can be managed with cold compresses at the injection site and acetaminophen, if needed. Avoid pressure on the injection site.\nIt is important to always report serious or unexpected reactions to a health care provider. Pain or redness, or swelling that goes past the nearest joint (shoulder or elbow) or pain or redness, or swelling that persists for 10 days or more, should be reported to the health care provider that gave the vaccine.\nIf you are concerned about your health, please speak with your health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
