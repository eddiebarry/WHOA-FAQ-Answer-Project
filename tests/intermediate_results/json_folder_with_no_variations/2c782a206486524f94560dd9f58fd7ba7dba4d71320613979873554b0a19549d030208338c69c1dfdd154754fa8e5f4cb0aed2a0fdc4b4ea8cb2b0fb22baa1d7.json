    "Master Answer": "There is no central registry of all immunizations provided in B.C.\u00a0 A paper record would have been given at the time of immunization. If you no longer have a copy of all of your child's immunization records, and you require proof of immunization or immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases you can:\n\n\t\tContact your local public health unit if your child was immunized at the health unit and request a copy of their immunization records. If your child was immunized in school, your local public health unit should have these records.\u00a0\n\n\t\tContact your family doctor if he/she provided immunizations and request a copy of the immunization records.\u00a0\nTo find a public health unit near you, visit: http://immunizebc.ca/finder.\n",
