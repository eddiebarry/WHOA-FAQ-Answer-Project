However, since 2012, the hepatitis A vaccine has been offered to all Aboriginal children and adolescents 6 months \u20ac\u201c 18 years of age as part of their routine immunizations. \u00a0\u00a0\nIf you are travelling, it is important to know what vaccines you need before you go.\u00a0 It is recommended that you contact your local travel clinic preferably six weeks before you travel for information on vaccines recommended for your travel destination. \u00a0You can find a list of travel clinics in BC here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
