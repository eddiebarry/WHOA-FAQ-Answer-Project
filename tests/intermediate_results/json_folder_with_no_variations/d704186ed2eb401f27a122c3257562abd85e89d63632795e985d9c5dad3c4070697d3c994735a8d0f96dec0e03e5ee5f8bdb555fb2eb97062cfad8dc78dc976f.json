    "Master Answer": "The\u00a0Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine is not recommended for infants under 12 months of age:\n\n\t\tInfants under 12 months of age may not respond to the measles component of the vaccine due to the presence of antibodies received from their mother during pregnancy.\n\n\t\tMMR vaccine is only recommended for infants 6 \u20ac\u201c 11 months of age if traveling overseas to areas with ongoing measles outbreaks. Such infants would still require 2 doses of MMR vaccine after 12 months of age. To receive vaccines related to travel, contact a travel health clinic.\nRead more about measles and the MMR vaccine here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
