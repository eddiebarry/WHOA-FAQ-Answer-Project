    "Master Answer": "MMR is recommended for infants 6 \u20ac\u201c 11 months of age if traveling overseas to areas with ongoing measles outbreaks. Your daughter would still require 2 doses of MMR vaccine after 12 months of age. Please contact your local public health unit to arrange an appointment. You will find the number here. To receive other vaccines related to travel, contact a travel health clinic. It is recommended that you visit a travel clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before you travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose.\nRead more about measles and the MMR vaccine here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
