    "Master Answer": "The need for an immunization appointment will vary by provider. At a local health unit or doctor's office, usually, an appointment is required. Sometimes there are advertised drop-in clinics during a disease outbreak or specific immunization campaign. Use the health unit finder. If your child is over 5 years of age, Pharmacists are available and may not require an appointment.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
