    "Master Answer": "Immunization is not mandatory in BC. However, it is strongly recommended that children are immunized according to the routine schedule and that they get all vaccines on time.\u00a0 All of the recommended vaccines are important and protect children against diseases that can cause serious illness and even death. Skipping vaccines leaves children at risk for serious diseases at a time when they need protection most.\u00a0\nWe encourage you to discuss your concerns further with your family doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\nYou can also visit our Why we Immunize and Infant Immunization sections for more information on the importance of immunization and why it's best to follow the routine schedule.\u00a0\n",
