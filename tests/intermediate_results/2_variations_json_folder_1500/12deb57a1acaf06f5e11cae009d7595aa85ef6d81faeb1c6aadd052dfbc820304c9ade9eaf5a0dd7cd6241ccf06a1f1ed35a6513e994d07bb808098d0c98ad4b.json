    "Master Answer": "Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends which type of flu virus strains to include in the vaccine. In Hong Kong the composition follows the recommendations by the WHO for the 2019-20 northern hemisphere influenza season. The UK also follows the recommendations of the WHO.
