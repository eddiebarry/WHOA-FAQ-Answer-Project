    "Master Answer": "Tips for locating immunization records are here. If you have a serious cut or wound, including punctures, bites, burns or scrapes, it is recommended that you see your health care provider immediately for treatment. Talk to your doctor, immunizing pharmacist or local health unit about getting a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine as soon as possible if you have a dirty cut or wound and 5 or more years have passed since your last Td vaccine. Use the health unit finder.\nIf you have further questions about tetanus or immunization, speak with your health care provider or call 8-1-1 to speak with a registered nurse at HealthlinkBC.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
