    "Master Answer": "In BC, schools do not store/provide students' immunization records.\nDepending on where you went to school in BC, you should have been given a paper vaccine record to take home and keep as proof of the vaccine(s). The health unit would also retain a paper copy. In some areas, the grade 6 vaccine paper record may have also been entered into an electronic public health information system.
