    "Master Answer": "Yes, it is possible for your child can get immunized while in Canada.\u00a0 Travelers to British Columbia (BC) from outside of Canada may be immunized according to the BC routine immunization schedule while they are in the province. Vaccines provided as part of BC's routine immunization schedule are publicly funded (free) and are available from public health units. \u00a0\nVaccines that are not publicly funded in BC can be purchased at travel clinics. \u00a0If you choose to purchase vaccines at a travel clinic, you would need to visit a travel clinic that is not part of a pharmacy as pharmacists in BC only immunize people 5 years of age and older.\u00a0\nAppointments are required at both public health units and travel clinics. It's best to book well in advance. \u00a0We recommend that you contact the\u00a0public health unit and/or travel clinic in the city or town in BC that you will be visiting for more information.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
