    "Master Answer": "Your daughter would be considered protected if she has 2 documented doses of mumps, given at least 12 months of age and over with the doses separated by at least 4 weeks. If so, she would not need another dose. Based on your daughter's year of birth, the routine immunization schedule at that time included MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) at 12 and 18 months of age. If you don't have a copy of your daughter's immunization history, tips for finding records are here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
