    "Master Answer": "You can check with your community health centre for your immunization records if you were immunized at the health centre or in school. You will find the number here. Ask to speak to a Public Health Nurse who can help you determine what publically funded (free) vaccines you may be eligible for. You can get publicly funded vaccines from your community health centre, most pharmacies, and some doctors' offices. You can purchase non-publicly funded vaccines at most pharmacies and travel clinics. Services vary throughout B.C.
