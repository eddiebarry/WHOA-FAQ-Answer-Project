    "Master Answer": "The immunization schedule can be calculated using either weeks or calendar months. In the routine immunization schedule, a baby is at least eight weeks of age at the 2-month visit, and eight weeks should pass between the 2 and 4-month visits. Contact the health care provider that gave the 2-month vaccines and ask them for the earliest date for the 4-month vaccines. You can book an immunization appointment at your local health unit.\u00a0Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
