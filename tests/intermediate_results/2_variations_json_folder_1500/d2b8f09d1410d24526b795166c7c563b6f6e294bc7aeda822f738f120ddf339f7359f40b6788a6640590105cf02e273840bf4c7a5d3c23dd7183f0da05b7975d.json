    "Master Answer": "Inactivated vaccines are generally safe in pregnancy. Tetanus is an inactivated vaccine. If a pregnant woman is due for a tetanus shot, there is no cost. The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine may be recommended for pregnant women at 26 weeks of pregnancy or later who have not received a dose of pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood. This dose is not routinely provided for free in B.C. Speak to your health care provider about this. Or, you can call your local community health centre/public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the number here. You can also find more information about vaccines and pregnancy here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
