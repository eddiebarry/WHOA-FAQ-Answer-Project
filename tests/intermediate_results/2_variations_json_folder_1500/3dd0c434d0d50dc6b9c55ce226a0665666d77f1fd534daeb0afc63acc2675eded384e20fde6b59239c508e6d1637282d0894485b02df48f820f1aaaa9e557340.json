    "Master Answer": "Immunization is not mandatory in BC.\u00a0 Unimmunized children are able to attend public institutions.\u00a0 However, private institutions may be able to set their own requirements. The Federation of Independant Schools Associations may be able to provide you with more information regarding this or refer you to someone who can.\u00a0\nIt is recommended that children are up-to-date with their immunizations prior to entering a childcare facility or school.\u00a0 If someone at a childcare facility or school has a vaccine-preventable disease, children who are unimmunized or who don't have a record of immunization may be asked to stay home until it is safe to return. \u00a0This rule is designed to keep unimmunized children from getting sick and to keep the outbreak from spreading.\n",
