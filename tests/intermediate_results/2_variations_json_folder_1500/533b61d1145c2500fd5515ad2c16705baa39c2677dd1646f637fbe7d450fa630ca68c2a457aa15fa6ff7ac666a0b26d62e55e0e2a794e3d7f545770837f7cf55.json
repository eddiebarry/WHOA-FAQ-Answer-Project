    "Master Answer": "It is not safe for a 2-month-old to have contact with anyone who has pertussis (whooping cough), regardless of whether or not they have received their 2-month vaccines. Infants need multiple doses of the pertussis vaccine to be protected and even when the recommended number of doses have been received, protection cannot be guaranteed.\u00a0\nPertussis can cause complications such as pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. These complications happen most often in infants under 1 year of age.\u00a0\nFurther, anyone who has contact with someone with pertussis is at risk of contracting pertussis and passing it onto others, including infants. \u00a0\u00a0\nWe recommend that you contact your local public health unit for more information and for advice in your situation.\u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeople who have symptoms of pertussis should follow up with their health care provider right away to be assessed.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
