    "Master Answer": "Vaccines contain small amounts of specific ingredients (also called components), all of which play necessary and important roles during vaccine production. All of these ingredients are safe in the amounts used in vaccines.\u00a0A list of the ingredients in each vaccine can be found in the Canadian Immunization Guide or the vaccine's product monograph available through Health Canada's Drug Product Database.\u00a0Vaccine product monographs can also be accessed directly from a vaccine manufacturer's website. BC routine immunization schedules for all ages are available here. Read more about the purpose of vaccine ingredients here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
