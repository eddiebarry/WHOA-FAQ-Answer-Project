    "Master Answer": "Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine\u00a0is a live vaccine and contains a weakened form of the viruses that it protects against. A mild fever, a rash that looks like measles and swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck can occur about 7 to 12 days after getting the vaccine. Six to 23 days after immunization with MMR vaccine, approximately 5% of immunized children experience malaise and fever (with or without rash) lasting up to 3 days. This is more common with the first dose of MMR vaccine than the second dose.\nYour daughter-in-law may contact the health care provider who gave the MMR vaccine with any questions or concerns about potential vaccine side effects. She may also contact her local health unit. Use the health unit finder.\nRegistered nurses at HealthLink BC can help with non-emergency health concerns, to discuss symptoms and to recommend whether to see a health care provider in person. Call 8-1-1 anytime.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
