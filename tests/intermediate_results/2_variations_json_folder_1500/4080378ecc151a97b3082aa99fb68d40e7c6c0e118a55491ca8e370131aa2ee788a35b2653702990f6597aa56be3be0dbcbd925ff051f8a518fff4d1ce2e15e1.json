    "Master Answer": "MMR vaccine is only recommended for infants 6 \u20ac\u201c 11 months of age if travelling overseas to areas with ongoing measles outbreaks (currently in the Philippines and many other areas). Such infants would still require 2 doses of MMR vaccine after 12 months of age. To receive vaccines related to travel, contact a travel health clinic. When travelling with a baby overseas, it is recommended to visit a travel health clinic, as more than the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine\u00a0may be recommended for you and your baby.\nThe MMR vaccine is also available from health units and some doctors' offices. Services vary across BC. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
