    "Master Answer": "We do not have a list of vaccines that people would have been offered based on birth year. You can contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. The public health nurse can refer to the\u00a0History of Immunization in BC\u00a0section of the BCCDC Immunization Manual and\u00a0can give you an idea of which vaccines you would have likely been offered.\u00a0\nHowever, without a record of immunization a person is considered unimmunized. \u00a0You can find information on locating immunization records here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
