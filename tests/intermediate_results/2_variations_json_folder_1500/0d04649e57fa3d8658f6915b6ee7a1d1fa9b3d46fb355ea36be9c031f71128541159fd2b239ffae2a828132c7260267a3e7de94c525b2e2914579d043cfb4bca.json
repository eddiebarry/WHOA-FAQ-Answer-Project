    "Master Answer": "The risk with delaying vaccines is that it leaves children at risk for the diseases vaccines prevent longer and at a time when they are most vulnerable. \u00a0It is recommended that children get immunized on time; however, there are a number of reasons why a child may not be able to get immunized on time.\u00a0 In these circumstances, children should get immunized as close to the recommended time as possible. \u00a0\nYou can visit our Infant Immunizations page\u00a0for more information. \u00a0If you have further questions or would like information on immunization clinics in your area, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. \u00a0The public health nurse may also have information on transportation options in your community.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
