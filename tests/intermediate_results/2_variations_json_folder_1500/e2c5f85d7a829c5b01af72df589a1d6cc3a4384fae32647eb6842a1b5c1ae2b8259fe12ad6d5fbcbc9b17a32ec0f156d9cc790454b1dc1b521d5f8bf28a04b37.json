    "Master Answer": "The chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is a live vaccine given by injection (paternally). Dukoral is an inactivated Cholera and ETEC Diarrhea Vaccine taken by mouth (orally). If you have questions about a travel vaccine and how to take it, speak with the travel health care provider that prescribed the vaccine.\nAs a general principle, live vaccines and inactivated vaccines do not interfere with one another, so they don't need to be separated by any time frame.\u00a0Live vaccines are made from a weakened version of the germ (virus or bacteria) that causes the disease.\u00a0Inactivated vaccines are made from a killed germ (or parts of the germ for subunit vaccines) that causes the disease. Since the vaccine does not contain a live germ, there is no growth of the germ in the vaccinated person.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
