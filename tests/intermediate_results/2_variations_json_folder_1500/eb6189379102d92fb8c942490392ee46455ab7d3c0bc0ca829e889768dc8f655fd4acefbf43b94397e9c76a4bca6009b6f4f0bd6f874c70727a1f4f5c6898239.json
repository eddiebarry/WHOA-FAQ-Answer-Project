    "Master Answer": "Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that all pregnant women get the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine in every pregnancy to help protect the baby after birth. The pertussis vaccine is given as the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Read more about vaccines in pregnancy here.\nBabies don't start getting the pertussis vaccine until they are two months old.\u00a0When you get the pertussis vaccine, your body makes protective antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body to help fight off diseases. You can pass some of these antibodies on to your baby through your placenta before birth. If you are pregnant, please discuss the Tdap vaccine with your health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
