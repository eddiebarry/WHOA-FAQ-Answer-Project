    "Master Answer": "Vaccines are very safe and effective.\u00a0 Before getting a vaccine, your health care provider will tell you about the possible side effects of the vaccine. The side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever and subside after a day or two. The schedule for unimmunized adults is here. The vaccines listed are publicly funded (free) for those that are eligible. Please contact your local community health centre/public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number here. It will be important to mention that you will be a health care aide. There are also various options for where you can be immunized. The public health nurse can provide that information and answer any other questions that you may have.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
