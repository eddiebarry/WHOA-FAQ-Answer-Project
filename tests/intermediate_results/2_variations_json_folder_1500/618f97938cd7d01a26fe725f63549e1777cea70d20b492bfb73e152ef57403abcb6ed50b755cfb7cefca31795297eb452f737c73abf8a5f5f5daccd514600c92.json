    "Master Answer": "Individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection. This means that if you had measles in childhood, you are considered immune and don't need the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\u00a0\nThere is a special immunization schedule in BC for those who do not have a spleen. Speak with your immunizing health care provider to ensure you've had the recommended vaccines for your health condition and age. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
