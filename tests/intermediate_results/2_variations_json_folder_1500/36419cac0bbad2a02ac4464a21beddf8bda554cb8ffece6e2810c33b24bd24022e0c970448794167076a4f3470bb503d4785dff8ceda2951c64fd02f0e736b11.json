    "Master Answer": "Chemotherapy treatment does not eliminate a person's immune memory. However, chemotherapy can affect a person's immune system, making them more at risk for a number of vaccine-preventable diseases. \u00a0For this reason, it is important that you check with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse to ensure you have received all of the vaccines that are recommended for you based on the type of cancer you have been diagnosed with and the treatment you are receiving.\u00a0 It is also important that all household contacts and close contacts of people receiving chemotherapy are up-to-date with their routine immunizations.\u00a0\nYou can use our Public Health Unit Finder to find the contact information for a public health unit near you.\n",
