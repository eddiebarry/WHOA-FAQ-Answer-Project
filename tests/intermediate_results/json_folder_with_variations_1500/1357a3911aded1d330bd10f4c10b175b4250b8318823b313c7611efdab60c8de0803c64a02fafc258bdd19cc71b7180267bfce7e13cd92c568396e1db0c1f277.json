    "Master Answer": "A prescription is not required for the BC routine immunization schedule, including the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine is available as a series of 2 doses to people 13 years of age or older who have not been immunized. People do not need to get the chickenpox vaccine if they had chickenpox or shingles at 1 year of age or older and the disease occurred before 2004 or it was confirmed by a lab test.
