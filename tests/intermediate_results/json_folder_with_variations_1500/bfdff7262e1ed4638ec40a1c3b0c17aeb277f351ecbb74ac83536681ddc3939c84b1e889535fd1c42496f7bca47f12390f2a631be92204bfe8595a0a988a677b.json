    "Master Answer": "Immunizations received outside Canada can be considered valid (meaning they would not need to be repeated) if there is written documentation (an immunization record) that shows the vaccine types, dates given, and age at time of immunization, etc. are comparable with B.C.'s recommendations. A public health nurse at your local health unit can review your child's record and let you know if any of the vaccines need to be repeated. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
