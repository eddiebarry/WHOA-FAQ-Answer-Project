    "Master Answer": "The side effects of the flu vaccine are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. In addition to\u00a0 putting a cool cloth on the arm where your child got the vaccine, pain medication is fine. You will find more information in the Health Passport on pages 16-17. For further questions or concerns, please contact your immunization provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
