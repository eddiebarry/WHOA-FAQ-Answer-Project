If you are referring to a location outside of British Columbia, we do not have that information. If you are asking about HPV vaccine in British Columbia (BC), most vaccines in BC (including all vaccines that are routinely recommended in BC) do not require a prescription.\u00a0 We do not have a list of all of the vaccines that do not require a prescription.\u00a0 However, all of the vaccines routinely recommended for adults in BC are available without a prescription.\u00a0 You can find a list of these vaccines here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
