    "Master Answer": "In general, there is no need to delay getting immunized because of a cold or other mild illness.\u00a0 However, severe acute illness may be a reason to defer immunization. The risks and benefits of vaccinating a child who is more sick need to be carefully assessed. We recommend you speak with your health care provider. Or, you can contact your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
