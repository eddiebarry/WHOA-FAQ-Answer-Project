    "Master Answer": "By herpes on the face, we assume that you mean cold sores. The virus that causes chickenpox (the varicella zoster virus) is a virus of the herpes family but is not the same virus that causes cold sores (cold sores are caused by another virus of the herpes family, the herpes simplex virus). If a child has had cold sores, it is still recommended that they get the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.\nIt is not necessary for people who have had chickenpox or shingles at 1 year of age or older to get the chickenpox vaccine.\nIf this does not answer your question, please clarify and resubmit your question.\u00a0 You can also contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\n",
