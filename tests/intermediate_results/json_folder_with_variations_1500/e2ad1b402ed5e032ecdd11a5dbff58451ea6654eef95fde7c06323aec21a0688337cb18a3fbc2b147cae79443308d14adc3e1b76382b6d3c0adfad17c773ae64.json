    "Master Answer": "There is no general recommendation that advises against taking newborns out in public before they are vaccinated.\u00a0 Parents should make this decision after weighing the risks and benefits.\nEnsuring that people who are in close contact with your newborn are up to date with their immunizations can help protect your newborn, as can general infection control methods such as frequent hand washing.\nFor more information on the risks of taking an unvaccinated newborn out in public and on ways to protect your newborn and prevent illness, we recommend that you speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\n",
