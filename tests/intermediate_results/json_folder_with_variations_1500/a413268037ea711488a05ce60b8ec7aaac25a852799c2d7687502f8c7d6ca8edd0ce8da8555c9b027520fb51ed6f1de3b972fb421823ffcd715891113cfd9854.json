    "Master Answer": "Most vaccines require more than one dose over time to produce immunity and long-lasting protection. After an inactivated vaccine like Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine, it takes a couple of weeks for memory cells to develop (memory cells remember how to fight off the infection in the future).\nInactivated vaccines are made from a killed germ that causes the disease. Inactivated vaccines like Td require more than one dose. In general, the first dose \u20ac\u0153primes\u20ac\u009d the immune system and the second and/or third dose produces a protective immune response. Immunity from the Td vaccine declines with time and tetanus-containing booster doses are needed to ensure continued tetanus protection at least every 10 years.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
