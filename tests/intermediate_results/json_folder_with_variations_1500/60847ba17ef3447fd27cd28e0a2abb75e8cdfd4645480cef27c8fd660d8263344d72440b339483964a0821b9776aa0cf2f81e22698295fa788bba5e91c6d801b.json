    "Master Answer": "You can get publicly funded (free) vaccines from your local public health unit. \u00a0Publicly funded vaccines are also available from a number of pharmacies and some doctors' offices. You will just need to inform the public health nurse, pharmacist or doctor that you self-identify as MSM to get the free Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and HPV9 vaccines (the HPV9 vaccine is free for males 9-26 years of age who have sex with men). \u00a0Non-publicly funded vaccines can be purchased at most pharmacies or at a\u00a0travel clinic\u00a0- you will need to contact the pharmacy or travel clinic for information regarding cost. Influenza vaccines are usually available in October.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
