    "Master Answer": "For best protection, it is advised that children receive all of the recommended vaccines on time. We recommend that you discuss this further with your immunizing health care provider.\u00a0 He or she can tell you whether BC's routine immunizations can be provided in the country you are visiting or whether these vaccines should and can be given early and prior to your travel.\u00a0\nIt is also recommended that you consult a travel health professional to determine if your child needs any additional vaccines that are not part of the routine schedule prior to traveling.\u00a0 A travel health professional can also inform you of the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the area you are traveling to.
