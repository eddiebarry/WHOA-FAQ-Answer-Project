Due to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC, an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood.\u00a0 Those not eligible for the free vaccine can purchase the vaccine at most pharmacies and travel clinics.\u00a0 A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown (adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization are considered unimmunized). Those eligible for the free vaccine can get vaccinated at their local public health unit or pharmacy.\u00a0 Some family doctors also provide immunizations.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
