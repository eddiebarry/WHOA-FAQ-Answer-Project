    "Master Answer": "Tips for locating immunization records are here.\n\n\t\tFor all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine are recommended.\n\n\t\tIndividuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals.\n\n\t\tWithout a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection. It is safe to repeat vaccines.\n\n\t\tInformation about where to get the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine is here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
