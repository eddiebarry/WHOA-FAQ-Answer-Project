    "Master Answer": "Human serum immunoglobulin (Ig) does not provide long term immunity to measles. When an individual is not immune to measles and then exposed to the virus, Ig is given to those who are unable to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. (e.g., infants less than 6 months, pregnant women, severely immune compromised etc).\nIndividuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals. However, because you received Ig for a measles exposure in 1965, please speak with your health care provider and discuss your history of Ig, measles-containing vaccine and any history of measles disease.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
