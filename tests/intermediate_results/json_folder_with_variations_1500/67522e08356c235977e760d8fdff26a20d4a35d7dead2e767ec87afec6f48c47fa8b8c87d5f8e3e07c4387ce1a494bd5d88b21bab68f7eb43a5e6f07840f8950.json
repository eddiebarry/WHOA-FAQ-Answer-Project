    "Master Answer": "We do not provide travel vaccine advice here at ImmunizeBC, however the standard Twinrix dosing is 3 vaccine doses over a span of 6 months. Hepatitis B is part of the routine childhood vaccine schedule in BC which your daughters may already have had (Twinrix is a hepatitis A and B vaccine). We recommend that you contact your local travel clinic for advice on what vaccines they will need. You will need a copy of their immunization records for them to look at. You can find your local travel clinic here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
