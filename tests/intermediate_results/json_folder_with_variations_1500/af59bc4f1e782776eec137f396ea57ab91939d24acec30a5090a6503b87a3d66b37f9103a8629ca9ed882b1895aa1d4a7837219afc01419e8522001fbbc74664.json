    "Master Answer": "It is not clear to which initiative you are referring.\u00a0 Do you mean the Vaccination Status Reporting?\nIn Canada, the responsibility for health care, including immunization, is shared by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.\u00a0 Each province and territory maintains its own system for tracking immunization coverage. In most provinces and territories, immunization data is collected mainly on children. How provinces and territories record childhood immunization data may be different. Some jurisdictions have electronic databases to track childhood immunization data, while others use paper-based systems. Some use a combination of both. New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Ontario and now BC have immunization reporting requirements. The Province of Ontario has similar requirements as B.C. Under Ontario's immunization legislation (law), parents must report their child's immunizations to their local medical health officer. You can learn more about Ontario's reporting law here.\nIf you are referring to a different initiative, please resubmit your question.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
