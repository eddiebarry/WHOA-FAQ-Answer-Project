    "Master Answer": "The recommended TWINRIX\u00ae dosing schedule consists of 3 vaccine doses over the course of 6 months, with the second and third doses given at one month and six months following the first dose respectively. To help ensure adequate protection against hepatitis A and B, make sure you complete all 3 vaccine doses. Interruption of a recommended vaccine series of Twinrix does not require starting the series over again, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. You can contact your immunization provider to see if they have a record of your doses.
