    "Master Answer": "Immunization is not mandatory in B.C. However, in the event of an outbreak, children who are not immunized may be asked to stay home from school, childcare, or organized activities, such as sports and playgroups, until the outbreak is over, which can take several weeks.\nIt is strongly recommended that children are vaccinated. If you have concerns about vaccines, we encourage you to discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
