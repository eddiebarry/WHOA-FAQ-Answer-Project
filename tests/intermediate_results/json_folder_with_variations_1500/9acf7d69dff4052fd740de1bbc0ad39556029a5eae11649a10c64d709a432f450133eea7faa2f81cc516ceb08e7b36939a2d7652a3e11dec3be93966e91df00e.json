    "Master Answer": "All influenza vaccines (flu shots) available in Canada have been authorized by Health Canada and all of the influenza vaccines protect against the viruses recommended by the World Health Organization. Read more FAQ about influenza vaccines here.\nProvincial and territorial health authorities determine which of the available products will be used in their publicly-funded influenza immunization programs, so the brand of influenza vaccine may vary. However, at pharmacies and travel health clinics, you may be able to purchase other vaccine brands that are not part of the publicly-funded (free) program where you live. The Canadian Immunization Guide has a list of all the 2018\u20ac\u201c2019 influenza vaccines available for use in Canada\u00a0here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
