    "answer": "From your question, it is not clear which vaccine(s) your baby is having. For vaccine schedules, it is important that a minimum amount of time passes between doses of vaccines to ensure your baby's immune system has time to develop protection against the vaccine-preventable disease(s). If minimum intervals are used between doses to complete the vaccines quickly, there is not a change in the safety of the vaccines.\nAsk your health care provider to review his vaccine records and determine the earliest date for the next set of vaccines. In BC, some doctors' clinics and all health units provide vaccines to babies. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
