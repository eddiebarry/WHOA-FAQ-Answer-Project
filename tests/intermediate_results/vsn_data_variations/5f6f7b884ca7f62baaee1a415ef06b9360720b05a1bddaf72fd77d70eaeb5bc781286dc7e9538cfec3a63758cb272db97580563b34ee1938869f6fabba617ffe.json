    "answer": "There are many factors to take into account when travelling with children. If you are considering international travel, it is advised that you make an appointment at your local travel clinic for a full consultation with a travel health professional. A travel health professional can inform you of the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the area you are travelling to and can discuss your options with you. A travel health professional can also determine if your child can receive certain routine vaccines earlier than the recommended age and whether your child should receive vaccines that are not part of the routine schedule before travelling. You can find a list of travel clinics in BC here.\nUltimately, it is up to the parent to weigh the benefits and risks of international travel upon consultation with a travel health professional.\u00a0\n",
