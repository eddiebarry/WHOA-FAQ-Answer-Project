    "answer": "The\u00a0influenza (flu) vaccine\u00a0 helps prevent influenza, it does not treat influenza.\nPeople who have already been sick with an influenza-like illness this season should still get vaccinated.\u00a0 Here are the reasons why:\n\n\t\tIt's possible that the influenza-like illness was not caused by an influenza virus as there are other respiratory viruses circulating along with influenza that can have influenza-like symptoms. \u00a0\n\n\t\tThe seasonal influenza vaccine protects against three or four different types of influenza viruses, which means even if a person has been sick with one influenza virus, the vaccine will still offer protection against two or three other influenza viruses.\nInfluenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illness until their symptoms have subsided. Vaccination should not be delayed because of minor acute illness, with or without fever. We recommend that you follow up with your immunizing health care provider who can make a recommendation for you. \u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
