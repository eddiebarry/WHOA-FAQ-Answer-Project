    "answer": "In BC, the Tetanus-Diphtheria-Acellular Pertussis (Tdap) is offered to grade 9 students. Check your child's vaccination record to see which vaccine he received last year: Td or Tdap.\nIf he received Td only, Tdap would still be recommended in grade 9 for pertussis (whooping cough) protection. There is no minimum interval (timing) between a dose of Td and Tdap when Tdap is being given for pertussis protection. If you have further questions, speak with a public health nurse at your local health unit. Use our finder here.\nImmunization Nurse",
