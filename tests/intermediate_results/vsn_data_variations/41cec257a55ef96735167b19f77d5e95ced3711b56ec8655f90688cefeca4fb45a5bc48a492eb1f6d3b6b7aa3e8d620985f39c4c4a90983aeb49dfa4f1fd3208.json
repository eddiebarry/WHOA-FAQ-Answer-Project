    "answer": "Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles (varicella zoster virus), can spread from a person with active shingles to cause chickenpox in someone who has never had chickenpox or received two doses of a\u00a0chickenpox vaccine. It is important to know whether your grandchildren have had either chickenpox disease or two doses of the chickenpox vaccine.\nA person with active shingles can spread the virus through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer infectious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If you have shingles, you should:\n\n\t\tCover the rash, avoid touching or scratching the rash and wash your hands often to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n\t\tAvoid close contact with people until after the rash blisters heal (develop crusts).\n\n\t\tIt is especially important to avoid contact with people who are at special risk from chickenpox, such as: pregnant women, infants, children, or anyone who has never had chickenpox; anyone who is currently ill; anyone with a weak immune system who is unable to fight infection (such as someone with HIV infection or diabetes).\nRead more about shingles on HealthlinkBC or call 8-1-1 to speak with a nurse or speak with your primary care provider.
