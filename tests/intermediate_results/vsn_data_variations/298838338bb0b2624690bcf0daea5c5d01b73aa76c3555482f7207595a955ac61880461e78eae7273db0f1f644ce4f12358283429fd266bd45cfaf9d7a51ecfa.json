    "answer": "Please seek medical attention if you experience a serious or unexpected reaction after a vaccine. Please contact the health care professional that provided the influenza vaccine directly to report your reactions. If you don't know who provided the influenza vaccine, you can contact a BC health unit near you and ask to speak with a nurse. Our health unit finder is here.\u00a0\nIt is often hard to tell if a reaction was caused by the vaccine, or if it was caused by something else. For example, if you get hives (an allergic reaction) right after a vaccination, it's more likely to be caused by the vaccine than if you get them the next day.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
