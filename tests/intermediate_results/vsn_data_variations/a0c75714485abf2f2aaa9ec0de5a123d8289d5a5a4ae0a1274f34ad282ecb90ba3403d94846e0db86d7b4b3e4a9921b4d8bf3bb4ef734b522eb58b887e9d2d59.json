    "answer": "You should discuss this with your health care provider, as the answer depends on the surgery you are having (if you will receive blood products) and the vaccine you need (whether it is an inactivated or live vaccine). In general:\n\n\t\tThere is minimal or no interaction between blood products and inactivated vaccines, such as hepatitis B and tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccines. An inactivated vaccine does not have timing rules before/after blood products.\n\n\t\tBlood products can interfere with the immune response to live vaccines\u00a0such as the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) or\u00a0 chickenpox (varicella) vaccines. A live vaccine does have timing rules both before/after blood products. If a blood product is administered less than 14 days after the MMR or chickenpox vaccine, it should be repeated at\u00a0again at a later date.\nImmunization Nurse",
