    "answer": "The Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine cannot cause measles disease in people with healthy immune systems. The MMR vaccine is a live vaccine and contains a weakened form of the viruses that it protects against. A mild fever, a rash that looks like measles and swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck can occur about 7 to 12 days after getting the vaccine. Six to 23 days after immunization with MMR vaccine, approximately 5% of immunized children experience malaise and fever (with or without rash) lasting up to 3 days. This is more common with the first dose of MMR vaccine than the second dose.\nContact your local health unit to ask further questions about the MMR vaccine. Use the health unit finder.\u00a0Registered nurses at HealthLink BC can help with non-emergency health concerns or questions by calling 8-1-1 anytime.\nImmunization Nurse",
