    "answer": "In 1986, only one dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) was offered to children 12 months of age and older. In 1996, a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine was introduced at 18 months as part of the routine schedule. That same year, the MR (measles and rubella) vaccine was provided to all children 19 months of age and older (toddlers, preschool children, elementary, secondary, and post secondary students) in a province wide campaign.\nImmunizeBC does not have access to your son's immunization records. If he needs a copy of his immunization records, there are several places to look:\n\n\t\tCheck your home for your son's paper record of immunizations.\u00a0 Try looking through baby books or other saved documents.\u00a0 In BC, childhood immunizations are most often recorded in the Child Health Passport.\n\n\t\tHe can check with the local public health unit if he was immunized at the health unit or in school. Public health units in BC now maintain an electronic registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health nurses but in 1986 they would have been in paper form.\n\n\t\tHe can check with his doctor if he was immunized at the doctor's office.\nIndividuals without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected. They should generally\u00a0be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.\u00a0 It is safe to repeat vaccines.\u00a0 Individuals can also have their blood tested for antibodies to determine their immunity to certain diseases. Your son's health care provider can help him determine what is best for him.\nImmunization Nurse",
