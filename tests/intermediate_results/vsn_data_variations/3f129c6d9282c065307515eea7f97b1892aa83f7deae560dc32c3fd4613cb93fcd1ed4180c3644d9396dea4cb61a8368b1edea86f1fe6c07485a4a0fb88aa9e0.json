    "answer": "For timing of vaccines, this depends on whether it is an inactivated vaccine (made from a killed germ) or live attenuated vaccine (made from a weakened version of the germ). Live vaccines must be given on the same day or separated by 4 weeks. Inactivated vaccines do not have to be separated from one another by 4 weeks.\nIndividuals with bleeding disorders should discuss this with the immunizing health care professional prior to immunization.
