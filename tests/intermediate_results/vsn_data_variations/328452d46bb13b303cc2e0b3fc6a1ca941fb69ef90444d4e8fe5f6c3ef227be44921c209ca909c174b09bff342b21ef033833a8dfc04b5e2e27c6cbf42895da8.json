    "answer": "The dose (amount) of a vaccine is tested and approved to ensure it is safe and it works to prevent that disease. Your baby needs to receive the full amount of the vaccine for it to work. For example, both premature babies in hospital and full term babies at home get the same vaccine dose starting at 2 months of age. A smaller baby is not at risk for increased vaccine side effects. Remember, most vaccine side effects are mild and resolve in a day or two. Read more about vaccine safety and vaccine side effects here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse",
