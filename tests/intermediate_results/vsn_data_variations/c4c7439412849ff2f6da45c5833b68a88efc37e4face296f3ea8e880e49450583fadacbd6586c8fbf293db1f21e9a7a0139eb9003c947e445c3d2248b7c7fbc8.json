    "answer": "Immunization is not mandatory in B.C., and thus a parent is able to choose which vaccines their child gets. However, for best protection against disease, it is strongly advised that children get all of the recommended vaccines and that they get them on time (according to the recommended schedule).\u00a0\nInfants and young children are at greater risk from vaccine-preventable diseases because their immune systems are less mature, and less able to fight off infection. If an infant or young child were to get a vaccine-preventable disease, it could be very serious and life-threatening. Following the recommended schedule provides the best protection as early as possible.\nWe encourage you to discuss your concerns further with your family doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\nYou can read more about why it's important to follow the recommended schedule here. You can read about the risks and responsibilities associated with delaying vaccination or choosing to skip vaccines here.\nImmunization nurse\n",
