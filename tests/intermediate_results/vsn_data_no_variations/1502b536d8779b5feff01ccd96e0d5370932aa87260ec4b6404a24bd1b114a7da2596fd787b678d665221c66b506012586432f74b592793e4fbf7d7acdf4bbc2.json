    "answer": "Many people who receive vaccines have no side effects. For those that do, the side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will usually go away after a day or two. You can read more about more serious side effects (which are rare) here. If you have more questions, please call your immunization provider or call your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
