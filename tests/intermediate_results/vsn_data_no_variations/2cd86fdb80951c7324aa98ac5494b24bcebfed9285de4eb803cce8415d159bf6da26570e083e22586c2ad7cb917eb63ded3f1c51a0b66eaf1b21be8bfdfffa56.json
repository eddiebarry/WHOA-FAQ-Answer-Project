    "answer": "We assume you are referring to swelling and redness at the injection site. Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site are common reactions to vaccines. These reactions generally last one to two days but can sometimes last longer.\nIf you have concerns regarding a vaccine reaction, it is recommended that you contact the health care provider that gave you the vaccine. Pain and swelling can be managed with cold compresses at the injection site and acetaminophen, if needed. Avoid pressure on the injection site.\nPain or redness, or swelling that extends past the nearest joint (shoulder or elbow) or that persists for 10 days or more should be reported to the health care provider that gave the vaccine. It is important to always report unexpected or serious reactions to a health care provider so that they can be investigated further.\nIf you are concerned about your health, please speak with your health care provider. You can also contact HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\nImmunization Nurse",
