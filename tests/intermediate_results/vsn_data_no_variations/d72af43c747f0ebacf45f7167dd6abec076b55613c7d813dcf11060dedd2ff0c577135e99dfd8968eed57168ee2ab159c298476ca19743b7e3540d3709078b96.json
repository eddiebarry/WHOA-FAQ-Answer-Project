    "answer": "Immunization is not mandatory in B.C. and parents choose to vaccinate their child or not. The policies for disease outbreaks have not changed. In the event of a vaccine preventable disease outbreak, children who are not immunized may be asked to stay home from school, childcare, or organized activities, such as sports and playgroups, until the outbreak is over, which can take several weeks. This policy is designed to keep unimmunized children from getting sick and to keep the outbreak from spreading.\nIt is strongly recommended that children are vaccinated. There are risks and responsibilities if you choose not to vaccinate your child, learn about them here.\nIf you have questions or concerns about vaccines please speak with your health care provider or call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse\u20ac\u2039\n",
