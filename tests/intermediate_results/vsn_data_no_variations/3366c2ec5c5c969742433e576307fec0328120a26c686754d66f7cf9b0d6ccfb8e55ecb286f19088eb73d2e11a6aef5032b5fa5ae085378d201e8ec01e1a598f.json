    "answer": "In BC, schools do not store/provide students' immunization records.\nDepending on where you went to school in BC, you should have been given a paper vaccine record to take home and keep as proof of the vaccine(s). The health unit would also retain a paper copy. In some areas, the grade 6 vaccine paper record may have also been entered into an electronic public health information system. Tips for locating immunization records are here. Contact the local health unit\u00a0where you went to school in grade 6 to ask about locating your vaccine records.\nImmunization Nurse",
