    "answer": "In Canada, all the provinces and territories (including B.C.) are responsible for buying the vaccines that they use in their publicly funded (free) programs. The Government of Canada coordinates this process at a national level to make sure that these vaccine purchases are coordinated, equitable and affordable.\u00a0In BC, there is not a mechanism to subsidize the cost difference between a publicly funded versus purchased vaccine for the health care provider or individual.\u00a0\nReceiving an influenza vaccine is the first and most important step in protecting against influenza. In BC, if you are an adult 65 years of age or older, you may wish to discuss influenza vaccine options (including Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose) with your health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse",
