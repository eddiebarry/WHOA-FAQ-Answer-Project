    "answer": "One dose of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is routinely recommended for adults 65 years of age and older. However a 2nd dose (offered 5 years after the initial dose) is recommended for people with certain medical conditions. We recommend that you speak with your health care provider to find out if you need a 2nd\u00a0dose of the vaccine and to find out if there are any other vaccines you need. \u00a0\nYou can find more information on adult immunizations here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse",
