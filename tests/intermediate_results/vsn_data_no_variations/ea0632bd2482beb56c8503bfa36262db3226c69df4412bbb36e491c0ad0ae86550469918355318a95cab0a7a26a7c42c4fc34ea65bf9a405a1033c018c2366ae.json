    "answer": "Vaccine schedules vary from province to province and country to country. You can contact your local public health unit for information on which vaccines you may have been offered in school in BC. Public health units in BC maintain a registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health in their area. If you were immunized in school, the local public health unit will have these records. However, without a record of immunization (or proof of immunity), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\n\u00a0\n",
