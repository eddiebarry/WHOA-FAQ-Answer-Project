    "answer": "It is recommended that children over 12 months of age receive two doses of the MMR vaccine before travelling outside of North America. Measles, mumps and rubella are endemic in many countries and therefore protection against these diseases is especially important for travelers. \u00a0\nWe recommended that you contact your local public health unit, doctor or local travel clinic as soon as possible to discuss this further and to discuss the possibility of your daughter getting her second dose of the vaccine prior to leaving the country. \u00a0\nIt is advised that individuals considering international travel consult their health care provider or\u00a0local travel clinic for information regarding travel vaccine recommendations prior to travel. \u00a0The nurses at ImmunizeBC do not provide travel vaccine recommendations.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse",
