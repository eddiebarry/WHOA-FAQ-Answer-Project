    "answer": "In BC, individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals. BC did not start offering measles vaccine until 1969. If you are born before 1970 and either had measles disease or measles-containing\u00a0vaccine, you are considered immune. Go here for symptoms of measles. If you have health questions, speak with a\u00a0nurse anytime at HealthlinkBC by calling 8-1-1.\nImmunization Nurse",
