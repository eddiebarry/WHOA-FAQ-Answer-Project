    "answer": "Until September 2016, grade 6 students received meningococcal C conjugate\u00a0vaccine (a type of bacterial meningitis) in BC. Starting in September 2016 meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine (protects against infection from four types of meningococcal bacteria:\u00a0types A, C, Y and W-135) was offered to grade 9 students. We recommend that you contact your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse to determine what vaccine was given in school and to clarify if the vaccine meets the university's requirements. Conjugate vaccines do not usually require booster doses unless the person is medically at high risk.\nImmunization Nurse",
