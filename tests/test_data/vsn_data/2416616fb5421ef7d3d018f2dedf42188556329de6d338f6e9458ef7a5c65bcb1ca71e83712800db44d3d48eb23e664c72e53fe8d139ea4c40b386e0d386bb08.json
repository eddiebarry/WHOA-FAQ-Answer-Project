    "answer": "In BC, the\u00a0Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine can be given to babies from 6-11 months of age who are traveling to measles endemic areas or who are contacts of a measles case. Babies who receive the vaccine early must still have two more doses over one year of age to ensure protection. Babies under one year of age may still have their mothers' circulating measles antibodies which interferes with their ability to make their own antibodies against measles.\nIf you have a baby under one year of age and traveling to measles endemic areas\u00a0 or your baby is a contact of a measles case, please contact a local health unit and ask to speak with a nurse. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse",
