    "answer": "The Shingrex vaccine is given as two doses, at least two to six months apart. A prescription is not required for the Shingrix vaccine for someone who is paying for it themselves. Shingrix is available for purchase from some pharmacies and travel clinics. The vaccine is not currently publicly funded (free) in BC however some health insurance plans may cover the cost of the vaccine. The best way for a person to find out if they have coverage is to contact their insurance provider/health plan directly. They can let you know if they require a prescription.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
