    "answer": "The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) can be purchased at most pharmacies and travel clinics. It cannot be purchased at health units as health units only provide publicly funded (free) vaccines.\nThe Prevnar 13 vaccine is recommended and provided free for adults at high risk of pneumococcal disease due to HIV infection or having had a stem cell transplant. It is also recommended by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization but not provided free for other adults with certain medical conditions. It is available for purchase for all adults that want protection.\nIf this does not answer your question or if you would like more information, please contact your local health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse",
