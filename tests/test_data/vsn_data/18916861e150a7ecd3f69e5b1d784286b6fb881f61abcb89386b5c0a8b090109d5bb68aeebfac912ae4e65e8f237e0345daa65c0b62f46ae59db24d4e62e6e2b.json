    "answer": "Finding Your Immunization Records\u00a0\nImmunizeBC does not have access to your immunization records.\u00a0 If you need a copy of your immunization records, there are several places you can look:\n\n\t\tCheck your home for your paper record of immunization.\u00a0 Try looking through baby books or other saved documents from your childhood.\n\n\t\tCheck with your parents or other caregivers to see if they have a record of your immunizations.\n\n\t\tCheck with your previous family doctors. Keep in mind that immunization records are kept at doctors' offices for a limited time.\n\n\t\tCheck with your Occupational Health department if vaccines were provided by them.\n\n\t\tCheck with your local public health unit if you were immunized at the health unit or in school.\nWithout a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.\u00a0 It is safe to repeat vaccines. \u00a0You can also have your blood tested for antibodies to determine your immunity to certain diseases. Your health care provider can help you determine what is best for you.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
