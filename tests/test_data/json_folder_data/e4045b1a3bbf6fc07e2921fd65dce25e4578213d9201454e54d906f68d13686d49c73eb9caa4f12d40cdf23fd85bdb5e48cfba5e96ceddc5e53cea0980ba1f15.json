    "Master Answer": "Adacel \u00ae is the brand name of the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine.\u00a0 The Tdap vaccine is offered to all students in grade 9. \u00a0This is a booster dose for children immunized against these diseases at a younger age. The booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases. Most children will need this dose; however, children who have had a dose of the Tdap vaccine on or after their 10th\u00a0birthday do not need a dose in grade 9. We recommend that you speak with your health care provider or your child's school nurse \u00a0to find out if your child needs the Tdap vaccine. \u00a0You can get in touch with your child's school nurse by contacting your local public health unit.\u00a0\nFor more information about grade 9 immunizations, please see the HealthLinkBC File: Grade 9 Immunizations in BC. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n",
