    "Master Answer": "An immunized 4 month old child will have some protection against the vaccine-preventable diseases in which they were immunized against at 2 and 4 months. However, a child of this age will have not received all of the vaccines needed for full protection.\u00a0 Thus, this child would be at risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child if the unvaccinated child were to catch that disease. Further, infants and young children are at higher risk of serious illness if they were to catch a vaccine-preventable disease due to their immature immune systems and physical development.\u00a0 Once a child has received all of their immunizations, their risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child (or adult) decreases. \u00a0\nThere may be many instances in which your child may be in an environment in which there may be people who are not immunized.\u00a0 It is important to weigh the risks and benefits in making the decision as to whether you want your child to be in that environment. \u00a0We encourage you to discuss this further with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse. \u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here:\u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/finder.\u00a0\n",
