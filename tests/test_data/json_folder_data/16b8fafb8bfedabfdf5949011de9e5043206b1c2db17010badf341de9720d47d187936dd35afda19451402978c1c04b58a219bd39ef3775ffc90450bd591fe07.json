    "Master Answer": "A different immunization schedule is recommended for children who are 1 year of age and older but less than 7 years of age when starting immunization. \u00a0This schedule uses minimum intervals (the shortest time between two doses of a vaccine in a multi-dose series in which a protective response to the subsequent dose can be expected) to ensure children are caught up on their immunizations as quickly as possible.\u00a0 The vaccine dosages are not altered; however, children following this schedule receive fewer doses of vaccines overall than they would have received if they were immunized on time as per the routine schedule.\nA public health nurse can review this schedule with you and can also schedule an immunization appointment for your child. \u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here: http://www.immunizebc.ca/finder\u00a0.\n",
