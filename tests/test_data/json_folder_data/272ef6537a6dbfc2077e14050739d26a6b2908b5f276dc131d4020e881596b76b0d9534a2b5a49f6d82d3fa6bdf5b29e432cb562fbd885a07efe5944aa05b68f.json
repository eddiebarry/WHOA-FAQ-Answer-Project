    "Master Answer": "Children who have not received a dose of the\u00a0tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine\u00a0on or after their 10th birthday need a dose in grade 9.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Tdap vaccine\u00a0is offered to all students in grade 9. This is a booster dose for children immunized against these diseases at a younger age. The booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases.\u00a0\nIf you have further questions regarding which vaccines your child needs, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and to speak with the public health nurse that works with your child's school. \u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here:\u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/finder.\u00a0\n",
