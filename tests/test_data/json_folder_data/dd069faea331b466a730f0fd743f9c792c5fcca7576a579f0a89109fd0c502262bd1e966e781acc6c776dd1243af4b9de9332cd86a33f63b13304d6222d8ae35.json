    "Master Answer": "If an adult is unsure if they have received the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, it is recommended that they get one dose of the vaccine. Getting an extra dose of a vaccine when your immunization history is unknown is not harmful and ensures protection.\u00a0\nBooster doses of tetanus-containing vaccines given too frequently may cause an increased local reaction. Your health care provider can provide you with more information regarding this. \u00a0\u00a0\n",
