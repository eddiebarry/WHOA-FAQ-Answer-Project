    "Master Answer": "Immunizations start at age 8 weeks to 2 months. You will find the routine immunization schedule for infants and children here. If you click on the name of the vaccine on the left hand side, you will be taken to the BC HealthFile that will give you information about each vaccine. Immunization clinics book up early so we recommend that you contact your local public health unit soon so that you can get an appointment for the recommended time.
