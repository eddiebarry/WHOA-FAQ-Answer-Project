    "Master Answer": "Students' immunization information is confidential and is protected under the British Columbia's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).\u00a0 Whether children are vaccinated or unvaccinated is not shared with parents. If there is a communicable disease outbreak in a school, parents are notified and public health follows up.\nYou can find immunization coverage reports for different areas of the province here. Some health authorities (for example, Vancouver Coastal Health) publish immunization coverage by school and grade on their websites. For more information, please contact your local health unit.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
