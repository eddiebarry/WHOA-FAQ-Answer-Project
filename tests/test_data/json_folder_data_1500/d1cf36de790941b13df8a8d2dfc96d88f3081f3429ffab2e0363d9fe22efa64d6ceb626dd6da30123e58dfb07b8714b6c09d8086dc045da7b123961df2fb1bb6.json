    "Master Answer": "People who are immunocompromised are at high risk of contracting influenza and so getting a yearly flu shot is very important. Influenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illness until their symptoms have subsided. Vaccination should not be delayed because of minor acute illness, with or without fever.
