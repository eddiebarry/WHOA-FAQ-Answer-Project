    "Master Answer": "ImmunizeBC is an immunization resource for members of the public, not health care workers (HCWs). Please speak with your educational institution about their occupational health program and exemptions. In general:\n\n\t\tHCWs are at risk of exposure to infectious diseases because of their contact with patients.\n\n\t\tHaving immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases protects HCWs and may also protect patients from becoming infected by HCWs.\n\n\t\tAll routine immunizations, including booster doses, are recommended to HCWs.\n\n\t\tIn BC, there is an influenza prevention policy for all health care settings. More information is here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
