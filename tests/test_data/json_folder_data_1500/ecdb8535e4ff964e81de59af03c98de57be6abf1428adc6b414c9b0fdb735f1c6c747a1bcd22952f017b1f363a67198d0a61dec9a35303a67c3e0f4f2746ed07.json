    "Master Answer": "Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly communicable (easily spread) bacterial illness. Persons who have had pertussis infection should receive pertussis-containing vaccines as recommended because infection does not confer long term immunity.\nAdults should receive one dose of Tdap vaccine if they have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood, but is not provided for free in BC. Vaccines are available for purchase from most pharmacies, travel health clinics and some doctors' offices. Read about what vaccines adults need here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
