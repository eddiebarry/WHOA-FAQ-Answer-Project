    "Master Answer": "It is not recommended that anyone receive more than one dose of influenza (flu) vaccine in a season, except for children under 9 years of age who have never had a seasonal flu vaccine. These children need two doses.\nThere are two types of inactivated flu vaccines \u00a0available as part of the publicly funded (free) vaccine program. The vaccines for children protect against four strains of flu, and the vaccines for adults protect against three strains of flu.\nIf you have further questions, please speak with your health care provider. Find a flu clinic near you here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
