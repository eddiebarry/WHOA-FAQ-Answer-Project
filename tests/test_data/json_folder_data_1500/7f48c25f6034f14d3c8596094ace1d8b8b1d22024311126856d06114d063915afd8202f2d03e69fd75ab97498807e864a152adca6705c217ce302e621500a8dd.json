    "Master Answer": "Protective antibody levels against varicella (chickenpox) are reached within 4-6 weeks after vaccination; however, some level of protection may develop earlier.\nSerologic testing is not routinely recommended for healthy individuals after varicella immunization. However, for certain immunocompromised individuals, testing may be recommended. If you are a health care provider, please refer to the BCCDC Immunization Manual or contact your local health unit for more information. If you are a member of the public, please follow up with your health care provider for more information.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
