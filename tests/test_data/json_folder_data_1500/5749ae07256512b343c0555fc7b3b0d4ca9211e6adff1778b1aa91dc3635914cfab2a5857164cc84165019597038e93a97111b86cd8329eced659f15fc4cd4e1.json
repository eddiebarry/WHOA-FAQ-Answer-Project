    "Master Answer": "The mumps vaccine is combined with the measles and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine).\nA person born in 1994 in BC would have likely received either one or two doses of the MMR vaccine as part of their routine immunizations (depending on when in 1994 they were born). \u00a0However, the only way to be sure you received a vaccine is to have a record of immunization. Without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity to a disease, a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected.\u00a0 You can find tips for locating immunization records here. \u00a0\nThe provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.\u00a0 There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak.\u00a0\nMumps vaccine recommendations:\nOne dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:\n\n\t\tchildren as per the routine schedule\n\n\t\tstudents of post-secondary educational settings\n\n\t\ttravelers to outside of North America\nPeople born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).\nIf you are unsure if your immunizations are up-to-date, we recommend that you contact your\u00a0local public health unit\u00a0and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can review your immunization records and let you know if you are missing any recommended vaccines.\u00a0\nVaccination is the best protection against mumps.
