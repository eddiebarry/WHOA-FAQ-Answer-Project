    "Master Answer": "We recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can assess your eligibility for the free hepatitis B vaccine.\u00a0 You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\nThe vaccine is provided free to people at high risk of hepatitis B infection. Additionally, the vaccine is provided by employers for Health Care Workers and others at occupational risk of exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g. dentists, dental hygienists, assistants and technicians, etc.). There is no charge to the employee; vaccine and administration costs are the responsibility of the employer.\u00a0 You can find more information about the hepatitis B vaccine, including information on who can get the vaccine for free, in the HealthLinkBC File: Hepatitis B Vaccine.\nYou may also be eligible for other publicly funded vaccines if you were not immunized as a child.
