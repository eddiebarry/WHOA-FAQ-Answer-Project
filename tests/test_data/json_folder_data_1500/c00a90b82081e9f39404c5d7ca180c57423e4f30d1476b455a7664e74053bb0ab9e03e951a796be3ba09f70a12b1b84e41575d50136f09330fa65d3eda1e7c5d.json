    "Master Answer": "Twinrix (combined Hepatitis A & B\u00a0 vaccine) is typically provided to adults on a schedule of 0, 1, 6 months. Travel health clinics\u00a0 also provide a 3-dose accelerated Twinrix schedule to adults before travel departure and a booster at least 12 months later. Your wife may have received an accelerated series 13 years ago and the travel health clinic provided a booster now. If your wife has questions about the safety of vaccines she received, she should speak with the immunizing healthcare provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
