    "Master Answer": "If you are an adult 65 years of age or older, you may wish to discuss Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose and Fluad\u00ae\u00a0 with your health care provider. For the 2018/19 influenza season, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization concluded that there is good evidence that Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose provides better protection compared with standard-dose influenza vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older.\u00a0\n\n\t\tFluzone\u00ae High-Dose\u00a0contains four times the antigen (the part of the vaccine that prompts the body to make antibodies) of a standard-dose influenza vaccine. The additional antigen is intended to create a stronger immune response (more antibodies) in older individuals, who generally respond at lower levels than younger individuals.\n\n\t\tFluad\u00ae is a MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine for use in adults 65 years of age and older. Fluad\u00ae may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in the elderly compared to unvaccinated individuals.\nBoth of these vaccines are not currently publicly funded (free) in BC, but may be available for purchase from some pharmacies and travel health clinics. Services vary across BC and you would have to contact your local pharmacies to inquire about availability. Use our influenza (flu) clinic finder here\u00a0and call to ask about influenza vaccines available for purchase.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
