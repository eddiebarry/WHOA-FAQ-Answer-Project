    "Master Answer": "It is recommended that you have your immunization record translated into English. This allows for your health care provider in BC to review your record to ensure you have received all of the recommended vaccines. \u00a0Vaccine recommendations differ between countries. \u00a0A translated record may also be required in the future (e.g., for employment, school or travel).\u00a0\nTo ensure accurate translation, it is recommended that you get your record translated at your local public health unit. A public health nurse can also review your record and let you know if you are missing any of the recommended vaccines.\u00a0 You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\n",
