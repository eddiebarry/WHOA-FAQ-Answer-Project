    "Master Answer": "At ImmunizeBC we cannot determine the travel vaccines you may require. Please consult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before you travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose. You can read more about travel vaccines here.\nThere is a charge for most travel vaccines.\u00a0Travel vaccines are available from travel health clinics, most pharmacies, and some doctors' offices.
