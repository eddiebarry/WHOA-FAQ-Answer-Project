    "Master Answer": "The tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine offered in grade 9 is a booster dose for children who were immunized against these diseases at a younger age. Protection from these diseases decreases with time. The booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases.\u00a0\nIn early childhood, children are routinely given a series of doses of the tetanus-containing vaccine (the tetanus vaccine is combined with other vaccines).\u00a0 This is because more than one dose is needed to build immunity and to be protected against disease. Children get a booster dose before they start kindergarten and again in grade 9.\u00a0 Receiving multiple doses of a vaccine is safe and ensures protection.\u00a0 You can find the BC's routine vaccine schedules for infants & children and school age children here.\u00a0\nThe following HeathLinkBC File has information on grade 9 immunizations, including information on common reactions to the vaccines and who should not get a vaccine:\n\n\t\tHealthLinkBC File: Grade 9 Immunizations in B.C.\u00a0\nIf you have further quesitons, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here. \u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
