    "Master Answer": "Vaccines do not cause autism. There is no scientific evidence of a link between vaccines and autism. Because children with autism are often diagnosed after the age when they receive some vaccines, some people have argued that vaccines cause autism. But just because one thing happens after another, it does not mean there is a link between them.\nMuch of the controversy around a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism came from a single small study published in 1998. The study was found to be fraudulent and was withdrawn by the journal that published it. Many large scientific studies around the world have since been conducted and have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.
