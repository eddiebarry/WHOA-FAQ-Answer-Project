    "Master Answer": "In Canada, individuals with a history of an anaphylactic (severe life-threatening allergic) reaction to eggs should generally not receive RabAvert\u00ae (rabies) or yellow fever (travel related) vaccines. There is no contraindication to receiving vaccines if you have a peanut allergy. A peanut or egg allergy is not a contraindication or precaution to receiving the Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine.\nBefore getting a vaccine, your health care provider will tell you about the contraindications or possible side effects of the vaccine. It's important to be open with your health care provider and ask any questions you have and tell them about any allergies or health conditions.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
