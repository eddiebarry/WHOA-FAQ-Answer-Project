    "Master Answer": "On ImmunizeBC, information for adults is\u00a0here\u00a0and includes information on vaccines that are publicly funded (free) and for purchase. ImmunizeCanada's resource section for adults is\u00a0here. Vaccines specifically marketed for adults or seniors typically have a promotional campaign(s) through the company that manufactures the vaccine(s). Contact your local health unit for information on community partnerships to improve vaccine access (e.g., New Canadians). Find your health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
    "Master Question": "I am wondering if there are any public initiatives to raise awareness regarding adult and senior vaccinations such as shingles, pertussis and IPD? Are there public subsidies? Are there any programs for immigrants who have barriers towards accessing these vaccine programs?\n",
