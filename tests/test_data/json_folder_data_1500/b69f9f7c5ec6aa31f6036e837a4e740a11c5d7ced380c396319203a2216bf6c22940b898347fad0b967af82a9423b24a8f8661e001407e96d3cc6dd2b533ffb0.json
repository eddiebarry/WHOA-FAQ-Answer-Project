Many universities and colleges and their programs require proof of certain vaccines. You may find some useful tips for locating immunization records here.\u00a0 Children without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected. These children should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.\u00a0 It is safe to repeat vaccines.\u00a0 Children can also have their blood tested for antibodies to determine their immunity to certain diseases.
