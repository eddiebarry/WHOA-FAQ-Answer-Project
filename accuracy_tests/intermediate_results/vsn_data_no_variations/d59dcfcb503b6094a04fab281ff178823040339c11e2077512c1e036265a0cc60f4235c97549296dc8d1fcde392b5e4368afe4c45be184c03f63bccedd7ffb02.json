    "answer": "Using public transit is not one of the criteria for free flu vaccine. For information about who is eligible for free flu vaccine check here. To find out if you are eligible for a free flu shot based on other criteria, speak with your health care provider. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization\u00a0recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older gets an influenza vaccine, with rare exception but not all people can get the free vaccine. If you do not qualify for free flu vaccine, many pharmacies and some doctor's offices provide flu vaccine for a fee. To find a flu clinic near you, check here.\nImmunization Nurse",
