    "answer": "In BC there was not a measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine program when you were in school. In BC, adults born before 1970 are considered immune (protected) against measles and mumps through natural infection (disease). For adults born after January 1, 1957, one dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for protection against rubella. If you haven't had one dose of MMR, you can get the vaccine for free at a local health unit, most pharmacies and some doctors' offices. Find your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse",
