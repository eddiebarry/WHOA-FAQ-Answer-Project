    "answer": "ImmunizeBC is funded by the BC Ministry of Health. It is a collaborative project of the BC Ministry of Health, the BC Centre for Disease Control (an agency of the BC Provincial Health Services Authority), the regional health authorities (First Nations Health Authority, Fraser Health, Interior Health, Island Health, Northern Health and Vancouver Coastal Health), the BC Pharmacy Association and the Public Health Association of BC. Our mission is to improve the health of British Columbians by continuing to reduce the number of vaccine-preventable diseases, along with the illness, disability, and death that they cause. We do that by providing solid, evidence-based information about immunization to BC residents, along with tools to make it easier for BC families to get vaccinated. This site is an important part of that work.\nImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
