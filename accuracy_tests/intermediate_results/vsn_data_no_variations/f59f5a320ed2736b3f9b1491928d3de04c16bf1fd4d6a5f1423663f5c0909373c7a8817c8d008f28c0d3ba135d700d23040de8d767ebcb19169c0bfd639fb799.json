    "answer": "We do not provide travel vaccine recommendations at ImmunizeBC.\u00a0 When travelling internationally, you and your baby may be at risk for a number of diseases that are rarely found in Canada but are common in other parts of the world. Travel vaccines will provide you and your baby with important protection.\nConsult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before you travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose. There is a charge for most travel vaccines. You can read about travel vaccines here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
