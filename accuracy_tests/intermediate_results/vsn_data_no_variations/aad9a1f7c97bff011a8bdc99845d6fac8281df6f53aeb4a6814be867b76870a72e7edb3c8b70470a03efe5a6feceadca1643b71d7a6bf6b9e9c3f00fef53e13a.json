    "answer": "Some vaccines are publicly funded (free) in British Columbia and others are not. To see what vaccines are recommended and publicly funded, check here. You will find recommended schedules of vaccines by age groups.\u00a0 In B.C., decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations from the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee. This expert scientific committee looks at statements issued by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization, the published literature, product monograph, as well as provincial epidemiology (how often the disease occurs in different groups of people in the province) and available health economic analyses. It also considers issues related to feasibility of implementation, resource requirements, and other related considerations. Recommendations for new vaccine programs or expansions are considered by the Ministry of Health against other new health initiatives. If you have further questions, please contact your immunization provider or call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number for your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
