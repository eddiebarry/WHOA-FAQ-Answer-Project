    "answer": "Medicines are given at different doses based on body weight. Medicines work when a certain level is present in the bloodstream; therefore, the weight of a person is important. Vaccines work differently.\nFor a vaccine to work, the cells of the immune system are important, and because of this vaccines\u00a0typically require very low amounts of active ingredients.\u00a0Immune system cells are throughout the body, and they respond to the vaccine right where the vaccine is given. It is then the immune system cells, (not the vaccines) that travel throughout the body to help the body fight off the vaccine-preventable\u00a0virus or bacteria in the future. The dose (amount) of a vaccine given is\u00a0researched and chosen during the phases of vaccine development, different doses are tested to determine the lowest effective dose for the target age group. There are specific adult and pediatric versions of many vaccines with different levels of active ingredients to ensure that the age group is protected against that disease.
