    "answer": "Vaccines are among the safest medical products available, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects. The side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. It is often hard to tell if a reaction was caused by the vaccine, or if it was caused by something else. If you have questions or concerns about the vaccine, we recommend that you call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
