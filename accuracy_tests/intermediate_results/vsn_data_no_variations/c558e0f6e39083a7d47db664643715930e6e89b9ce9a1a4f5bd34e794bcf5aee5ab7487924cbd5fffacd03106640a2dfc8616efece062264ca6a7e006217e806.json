    "answer": "An interruption of a recommended vaccine series does not require starting the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed (except for oral typhoid vaccine). Twinrix\u00ae (combined hepatitis A & B vaccine) is given to adults as three dose series over six months. Travel health clinics also do a rapid dosing vaccine schedule. Protection might not be attained until the recommended number of doses has been administered.\nBook with a travel health clinic for a review of your vaccine history and the clinic will recommend the vaccines you need.
