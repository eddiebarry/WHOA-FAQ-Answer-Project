    "answer": "Girls and boys are offered two doses of the HPV9 vaccine in grade 6. The second dose is given at least 6 months after the first dose. Three doses of the vaccine used to be recommended for students in grade 6, which is why the booklet you have lists three doses. However, more recent research has shown that only two doses are needed. If your child is in grade 6 and received her first dose of the HPV vaccine at a school clinic, she will be offered a second dose about 6 months later at another school clinic. If this does not answer your question, or if you are unsure if your daughter is up to date with her vaccines, please contact your local health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for health units in B.C. here.\u00a0\nYou can read more about school-age vaccines here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse",
