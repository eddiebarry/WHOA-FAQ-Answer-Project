    "answer": "There is no recommendation that a person waits any length of time to get pregnant after receiving the HPV vaccine.\u00a0 The HPV vaccine should not be given during pregnancy because the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy has not been well studied.\u00a0\nIt is not known how long protection from the HPV vaccine lasts.\u00a0 However, studies show that the HPV vaccine provides good protection for at least 10 years and that there is no evidence of weakened protection over time.\u00a0\nIf you are planning a pregnancy, it's recommended that you talk to your health care provider about\u00a0which vaccines you may need before, during and after pregnancy.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse",
