    "answer": "In general, protection starts to develop after about two weeks of getting a vaccine; however, a number of factors impact an individuals' response to vaccines. When travelling internationally, you and your baby may be at risk for a number of diseases that are rarely found in Canada but are common in other parts of the world. Travel vaccines will provide you and your baby with important protection. Consult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
