    "answer": "The polio vaccine is mostly given as a booster dose to adults who had a series of polio vaccine in childhood and are at increased risk of exposure to the polio virus (for example, through work or travel).\nThe schedule for the polio vaccine for an adult who has never been immunized is 3 doses. The second dose is given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 1 and the 3rd dose is given 6 to 12 months after the 2nd dose. You can also contact a pharmacy or a travel clinic to arrange to be immunized. If you have previously received a polio vaccine, the schedule will be different. If you have further questions, we recommend that you discuss them with your immunization provider. You can also call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse.\nImmunization Nurse",
