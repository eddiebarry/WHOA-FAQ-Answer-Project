    "answer": "In BC, there is no rule of having to wait between a dose of Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) and Tetanus-Diphtheria-Acellular Pertussis (Tdap) when Tdap is being given for pertussis (whooping cough) protection. Tdap vaccine would be offered to a child who had not received a booster dose of pertussis containing vaccine after 10 years of age.\nSpeak with healthcare professional to review your daughter's childhood immunization records, confirm the vaccine she was given 2 years ago and recommend if she needs a Tdap now. You can speak with a public health nurse at your local health unit. Use our clinic finder.\nImmunization Nurse",
