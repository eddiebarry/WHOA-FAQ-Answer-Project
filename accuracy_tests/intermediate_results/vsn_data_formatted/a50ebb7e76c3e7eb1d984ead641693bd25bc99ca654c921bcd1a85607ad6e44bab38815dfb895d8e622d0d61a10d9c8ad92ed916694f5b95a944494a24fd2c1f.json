    "answer": "The immunization schedule is designed to protect children before they are exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases. Children are immunized early in life because they are vulnerable to diseases and the consequences can be very serious.\nIt is important that children are immunized against tetanus and hepatitis B because these are serious and sometimes fatal diseases.\u00a0\nThe bacteria that cause tetanus can be found everywhere in the environment (usually in dirt and soil). When the bacteria enter the skin through a cut or scrape, they produce a poison that can cause painful tightening of muscles all over the body. It is very serious if the breathing muscles are affected. Up to 1 in 5 people who get tetanus may die. \u00a0\nHepatitis B can cause serious disease including permanent liver damage and is the main cause of liver cancer. When young children get infected with the hepatitis B virus they often do not have symptoms but most will stay infected for life. This is why getting protection from the vaccine at a young age is important.\u00a0\nYou can find more information in our Diseases & Vaccination section.\u00a0\nA Parent's Guide to Vaccination from the Public Health Agency of Canada is another great resource for parents.\nIf your granddaughter has questions about immunization, we would encourage that she contacts her local public health unit and has a conversation with a public health nurse.\u00a0 You can find the contact information for public health units in BC here: http://www.immunizebc.ca/finder.",
