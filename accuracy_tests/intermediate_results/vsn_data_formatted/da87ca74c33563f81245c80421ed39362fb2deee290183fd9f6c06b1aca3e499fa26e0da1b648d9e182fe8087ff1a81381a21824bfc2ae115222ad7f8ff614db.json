    "answer": "Vaccines are among the safest medical products available, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. For example, the estimated annual reported rate of anaphylaxis ranges from 0.4 to 1.8 reports per 1,000,000 doses of vaccine distributed in Canada. These statistics include all vaccine doses; not just those given to babies. The vast majority of side effects from vaccines are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever.\u00a0 The risks from the diseases vaccines prevent are much greater than the risk of a vaccine side effect. We recommend that you contact your local community health centre/public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse if you have further questions. You can find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse",
