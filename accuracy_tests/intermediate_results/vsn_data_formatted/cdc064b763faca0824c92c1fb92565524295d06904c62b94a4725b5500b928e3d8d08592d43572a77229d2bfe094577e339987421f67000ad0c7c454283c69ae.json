    "answer": "A 3 in 1 dose vaccine is not available for babies in BC. We recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse.\u00a0 If following this discussion you decide that you would still like for your child to receive only one vaccine at a time (per clinic visit) this can be accommodated. A 2 month old typically receives 3 injectable vaccines and one oral vaccine at 2 months of age.\n\tSome information to consider: Combination vaccines are safe. They provide all the benefits of the individual vaccines but in a single injection, so your child does not need to receive as many shots. Before a combination vaccine is approved for use, studies must show that the combination vaccine is just as safe and effective as each of the individual vaccines given separately. Research shows that the side effects of combination vaccines are similar to those of the individual vaccines given separately. The vast majority of side effects are very mild, such as temporary pain and swelling at the injection site.\nThe ingredients in vaccines have been carefully studied for a long time, and are safe in the small amounts used in vaccines. You may have heard or read that some ingredients are harmful, but this is true only at much higher amounts. Any substance, even water, can be harmful at a high dose. There is no evidence that any of the ingredients in these small amounts can cause harm.\nYou can visit our Ingredients section for more information on the safety of vaccine ingredients and the Vaccine Safety section.\nImmunization Nurse",
