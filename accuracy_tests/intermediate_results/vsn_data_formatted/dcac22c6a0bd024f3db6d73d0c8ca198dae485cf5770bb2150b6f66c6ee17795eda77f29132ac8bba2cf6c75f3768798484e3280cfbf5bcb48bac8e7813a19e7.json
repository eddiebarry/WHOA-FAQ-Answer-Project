    "answer": "By breastfeeding, you may pass some antibodies you have made in response to the MMR vaccine to your child.\u00a0 These antibodies may provide some protection, but this protection is limited and short-term and is not enough to protect a child from infection with measles, mumps or rubella.\n\tThe best protection against these diseases is vaccination. If your child is too young to get the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, the best way to protect your child is to ensure everyone around your child is vaccinated (close contacts, care providers etc).\u00a0 If you live in a community where there is currently a measles outbreak and would like more information on how to protect your child, we encourage you to contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse.
