There is not a recommendation for your child to receive a measles containing vaccine early. The efficacy (vaccine's ability to prevent illness in research studies) of a single dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85% to 95%. Also, the varicella (chickenpox) component of the combined MMR-V vaccine cannot be given before the 4th birthday.\nImmunization Nurse",
