    "answer": "Immunization is not compulsory in Canada.\u00a0 Therefore children are not required to have immunizations prior to entering school.\u00a0 However, it is highly recommended that children are up to date with their immunizations prior to entering school to protect both themselves and their classmates from the serious diseases vaccines prevent. \u00a0\nIf a parent chooses not to immunize their child, the child may be told they must stay home from school if there is an outbreak of disease. This rule is designed to keep unimmunized children from getting sick and to keep the outbreak from spreading.\u00a0\nFor more information, or to make an appointment to have you child immunized, please contact your local public health unit.\n",
