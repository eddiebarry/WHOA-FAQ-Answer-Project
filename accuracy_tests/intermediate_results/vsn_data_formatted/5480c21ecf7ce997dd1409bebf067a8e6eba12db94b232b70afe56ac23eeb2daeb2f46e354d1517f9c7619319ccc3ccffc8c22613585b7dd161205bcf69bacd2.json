    "answer": "When pregnant, a woman can only share antibodies against those infectious diseases she is immune to from vaccination or past disease. If present, measles antibodies (IgG) are shared through the placenta, from a woman to her developing baby. After birth, the amount of antibodies the baby has and how long they last for vary depending on the mother's level of antibodies, whether the baby was born premature etc. Breastfeeding primarily provides IgA antibodies, which mostly protect against diseases that affect the gut, such as diarrheal infections, not measles. In BC, the first dose of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine\u00a0is given at 12 months of age when the mother's antibodies are no longer circulating in amounts that will interfere with the baby's immune response to the MMR vaccine.\nFor further questions about measles protection and your baby (under 12 months of age), please speak with your health care provider. You can also speak with a nurse at HealthlinkBC by calling 8-1-1.\nImmunization Nurse",
