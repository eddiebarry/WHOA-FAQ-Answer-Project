However, for doses of vaccine to be considered valid, they do have to meet criteria for timing between doses (e.g. 4-8 weeks between doses) and minimum age (e.g. 6 months of age for influenza vaccine).\nA health care provider can review your baby's vaccine record and determine if she is eligible for her routine 6 month vaccines now or if due to scheduling March is the earliest possible date for next set of vaccines.
