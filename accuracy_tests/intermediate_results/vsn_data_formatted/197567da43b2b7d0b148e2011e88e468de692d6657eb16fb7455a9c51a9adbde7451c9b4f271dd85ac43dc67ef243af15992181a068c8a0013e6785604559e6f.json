    "answer": "In BC, all persons born before 1970 (except health care workers) are assumed to be immune to measles because they had measles disease in childhood. If you had measles disease, you do not need the vaccine. Those uncertain of their measles disease history can be offered 1 dose of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine. MMR vaccine is available from local health units and some pharmacies/doctors' offices. Services vary across BC. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse",
