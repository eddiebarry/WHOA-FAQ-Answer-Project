    "answer": "Anaphylaxis is preventable in many cases and treatable in all. Prevention of anaphylaxis is important. Pre-vaccination screening includes screening for a history of anaphylaxis and identification of potential risk factors. The standard information provided in the process of obtaining informed consent prior to giving vaccines includes the provision of emergency treatment of anaphylaxis.\u00a0While anaphylaxis is extremely rare, every immunization carries a risk of producing an anaphylactic (life threatening allergic) reaction.\u00a0\nAll immunizing health care providers in BC are required to be trained on how to recognize and treat anaphylaxis immediately.\u00a0Anaphylaxis management kits are readily available wherever vaccines are administered, containing epinephrine (the first line treatment for anaphylaxis) to stop the allergic reaction. If anaphylaxis were to occur, the health care provider gives epinephrine to reverse the allergic reaction and calls 9-1-1 to arrange for rapid transport by emergency vehicle to an emergency department. Please speak with your immunizing health care provider for further questions about vaccine safety and anaphylaxis.\nImmunization Nurse",
