    "answer": "The government approved mandatory reporting of vaccination status, not mandatory vaccination. The Vaccination Status Reporting Regulation that came into effect on July 1st requires parents or guardians to report the vaccination status of their school-age children to their local health unit. This mandatory reporting of the vaccination status of students will ensure the public health system is prepared in the event of an outbreak. Furthermore, with the up-to-date records, public health can reach out to families with children behind on their immunizations and provide an opportunity to catch them up, as well as discuss any concerns with parents. Health units will begin implementation of the regulation in September of 2019. You can read more about this regulation here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse",
