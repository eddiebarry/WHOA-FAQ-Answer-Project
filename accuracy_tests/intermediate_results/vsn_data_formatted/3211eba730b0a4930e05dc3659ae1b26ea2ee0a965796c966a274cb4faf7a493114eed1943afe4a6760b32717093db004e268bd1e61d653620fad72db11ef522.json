    "answer": "Adults should only have one influenza vaccine (flu shot) for the 2019/20 season. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used in people 65 and older. However, when available, NACI recommends that individuals 65 years of age and older should get Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose because it is expected to provide better protection compared to the other flu vaccines. Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose is not currently publicly funded (free) in B.C. It is available for purchase from some pharmacies and travel health clinics. For more information about Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose and which vaccine is right for you, talk to your health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse",
