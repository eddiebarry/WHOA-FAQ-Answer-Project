    "answer": "There is no risk to getting the flu shot while you are breastfeeding. Breastfeeding women should get the flu shot to protect themselves from flu. Getting vaccinated reduces your risk of getting sick and of passing the flu on to your baby, thus protecting the baby from flu also. This is especially important for children younger than 6 months old since they are too young to receive flu vaccine themselves.\nImmunization Nurse",
