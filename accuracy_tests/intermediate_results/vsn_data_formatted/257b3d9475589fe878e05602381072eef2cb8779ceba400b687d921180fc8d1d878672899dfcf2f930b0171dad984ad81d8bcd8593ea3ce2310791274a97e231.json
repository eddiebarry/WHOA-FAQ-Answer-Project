    "answer": "HPV9 vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination of females aged 9 to 26 years and may be used in females 26 to 45 years of age who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the series. The vaccine works best when it is given before sexual activity begins (and before any exposure to HPV). Most people who become infected with HPV first catch it within 2 to 5 years of becoming sexually active, so it is important to vaccinate them before they begin sexual activity.\nIf you have further questions, please speak with your immunuzation provider.\nImmunization Nurse",
