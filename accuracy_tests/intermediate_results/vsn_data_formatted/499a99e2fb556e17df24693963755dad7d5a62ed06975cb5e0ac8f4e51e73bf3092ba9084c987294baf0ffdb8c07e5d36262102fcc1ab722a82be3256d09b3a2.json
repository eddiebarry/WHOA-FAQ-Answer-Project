    "answer": "A child who has received their 2 month immunizations may have some protection against the diseases they were immunized against, however they will not be fully protected.\u00a0 This is because more than one dose of these vaccines is needed for full protection. There are also some diseases (such a measles) for which children are not routinely vaccinated against until 12 months of age. Further, additional vaccines may be recommended depending on your travel destination.\nWe do not provide travel advice or travel vaccine recommendations at ImmunizeBC and recommend that you contact your local travel clinic for this information. \u00a0You can find a list of travel clinics in BC here.",
