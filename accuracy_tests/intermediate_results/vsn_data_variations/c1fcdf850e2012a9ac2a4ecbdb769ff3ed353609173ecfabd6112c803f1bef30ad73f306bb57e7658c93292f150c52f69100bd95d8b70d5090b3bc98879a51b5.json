    "answer": "Yes. The same virus that causes chickenpox (the varicella-zoster virus) causes shingles. For some people who have had chickenpox, the virus can become active again later in life and cause a painful rash with blisters called shingles. \u00a0\nPeople can also get shingles after getting the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. However, people who get the chickenpox vaccine are less likely to have shingles later in life than people who have had chickenpox disease.
