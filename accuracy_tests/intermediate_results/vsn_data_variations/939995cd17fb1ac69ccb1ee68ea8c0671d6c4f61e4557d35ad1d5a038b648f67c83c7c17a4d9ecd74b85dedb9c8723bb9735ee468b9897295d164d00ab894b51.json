    "answer": "Vaccines (such as the hepatitis B vaccine) work by stimulating a person's immune system to make antibodies (proteins that fight off germs).\u00a0 The antibodies remain in the body and will protect against the germ (for example, the hepatitis B virus) if a person is exposed to it in the future. The hepatitis B vaccine provides long-term protection against the hepatitis B virus; however, protection is not immediate (it usually takes several weeks to develop antibodies against the germ).\nHBIg is hepatitis B immune globulin (immune globulins are different from vaccines). It contains large amounts of hepatitis B antibodies taken from donated human blood. It is given (as a shot) when immediate protection against hepatitis B is needed (for example, to prevent hepatitis B infection in people who have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus and have not received the hepatitis B vaccine).\u00a0 HBIg provides immediate protection because it contains pre-formed antibodies to hepatitis B.\u00a0 However, the protection is only short-term.\nYou can find more information about the hepatitis B vaccine here.\nYou can find more information about the hepatitis B immune globulin here.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
