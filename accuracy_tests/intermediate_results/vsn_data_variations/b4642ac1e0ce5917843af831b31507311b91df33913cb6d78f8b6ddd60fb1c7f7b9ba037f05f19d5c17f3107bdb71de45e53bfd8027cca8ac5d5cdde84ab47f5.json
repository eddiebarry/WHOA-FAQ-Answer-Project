    "answer": "In Canada, the HPV vaccines (HPV2, HPV9) protect against 2 types of HPV that cause about 70% of cases of cervical cancer and 80% of cases of anal cancer. The HPV9 vaccine protects against 5 additional types of HPV that cause 15% to 20% of cervical cancers and 11% of anal cancers in women and 4% in men. The HPV9 vaccine also protects against 2 types of HPV that cause about 90% of cases of genital warts.\nMore than 99% of vaccine recipients develop an antibody response to vaccine HPV types after completing a 3-dose series. The body usually starts to develop an immune response within 2 weeks after immunization with most vaccines and then the second and third doses of the vaccine boost that immune response.\nIf you are concerned about recent exposure to HPV or other sexually transmitted infections, please go to Smart Sex Resource for more information.\nImmunization Nurse",
