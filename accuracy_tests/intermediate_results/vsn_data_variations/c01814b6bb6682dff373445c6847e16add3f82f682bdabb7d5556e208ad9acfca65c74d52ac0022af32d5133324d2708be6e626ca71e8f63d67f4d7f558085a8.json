    "answer": "In BC, parents have the authority to provide consent for their child regardless of the child's age. (Except when a parents' decision-making rights have been legally revoked or when their child has consented as a mature minor on their own behalf). Both parents are not required to be present for a health care provider to obtain consent to give immunizations.\nA health care provider must defer the consent process if a parent discloses there are differences between parents who have equal authority to consent to their child's immunization. The health care provider cannot proceed with immunizations until a parent reports these differences are resolved. If you have further concerns around informed consent for immunizations, speak with a nurse at your local health unit. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
