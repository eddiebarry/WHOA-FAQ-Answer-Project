    "answer": "With your concerns about the vaccine schedule and safety, it would be helpful to speak directly with your doctor or a public health nurse who will give the vaccines. Use the health unit finder for a location near you. Read more about why vaccines are safe here.\u00a0The recommended schedule was created to protect infants and young children early in life, when they are most vulnerable, and before they are potentially exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nParents can choose to not follow BC's routine immunization schedule, but this is not recommended because:\n\n\t\tThere is no known benefit to delaying or spacing out vaccines.\n\n\t\tSchedules that delay or space out vaccines leave your child at risk of getting diseases while they are unvaccinated.\n\n\t\tDelaying or spacing out vaccines will increase the number of visits to your child's health care provider, which may increase your child's risk of developing anxiety and needle fear.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
