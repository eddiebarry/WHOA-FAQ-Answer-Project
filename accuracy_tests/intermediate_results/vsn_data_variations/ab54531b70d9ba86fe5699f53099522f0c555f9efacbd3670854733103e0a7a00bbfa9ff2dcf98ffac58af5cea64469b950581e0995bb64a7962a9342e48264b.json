    "answer": "In BC, there is no change to the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine schedule, with the recommendation to receive it at 12 months and 4-6 years of age.\u00a0 A baby from 6-11 months of age can receive the MMR vaccine when traveling to a measles endemic area or as a contact of a measles case. A baby who receives the MMR vaccine at 6-11 months must still have two doses over one year of age. Babies under one year of age may still have their mothers' circulating measles antibodies which interfere with producing their own antibodies and memory cells against the measles virus.\nIf you are travelling contact a travel health clinic. If you are concerned your baby is a contact of a measles case, speak with a nurse at your local health unit. Use the health unit finder.\nImmunization Nurse",
