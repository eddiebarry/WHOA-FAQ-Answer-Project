    "answer": "Yes. The first dose of these vaccines can be given at 3.5 months when you arrive in B.C. We recommend that you book your son's appointment in advance as clinics fill up quickly. You can use our health unit finder to find the contact information for the health unit in the city or town you are moving to. It is important to bring your son's immunization record with you to the appointment. A pubic health nurse will review your son's record and make sure he is caught up on his immunizations based on the B.C. recommendations.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse",
