    "answer": "We do not have immunization records at ImmunizeBC or information on when vaccines were offered in other provinces. Below is some information on pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine recommendations for adults.\nIt is recommended that all adults receive one dose of the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if they have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood. In particular, adults who have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine, ideally administered at least 2 weeks before contact with the infant. \u00a0Ensuring your pertussis vaccination is up-to-date can provide indirect protection to infants.\nDue\u00a0to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC,\u00a0an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood. \u00a0Those not eligible for the free vaccine can\u00a0purchase the vaccine at most pharmacies and travel clinics. \u00a0A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults\u00a0who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown (adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization are considered unimmunized). Those eligible for the free vaccine can get vaccinated at their local public health unit or pharmacy. \u00a0Some family doctors also provide immunizations.\u00a0\nProtection from pertussis vaccines decreases over time, so it's important to get a booster dose. \u00a0We recommend that you discuss getting vaccinated further with your public health nurse, doctor or pharmacist who can make a recommendation for you.\u00a0\nFor more information about the Tdap vaccine, see the\u00a0HealthLinkBC File: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse",
