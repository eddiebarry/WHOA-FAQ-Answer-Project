    "answer": "It is safe to receive the 4 in one but the recommended interval between any meningococcal C conjugate vaccine and meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (4 in 1) is 4 weeks. We recommend that you speak to your immunization provider to determine if you qualify for free meningococcal quadrivalent cojugate vaccine or whether you are at risk. If you don't qualify for free vaccine, you can purchase it at most pharmacies and travel clinics.\nFor more\u00a0 information about the outbreak in the Okanagan, please check the Interior Health website here.\nImmunization Nurse",
