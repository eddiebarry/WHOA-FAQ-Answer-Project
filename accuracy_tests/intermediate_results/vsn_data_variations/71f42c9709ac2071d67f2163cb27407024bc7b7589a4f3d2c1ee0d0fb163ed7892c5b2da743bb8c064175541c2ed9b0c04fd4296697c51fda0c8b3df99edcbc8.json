    "answer": "In Canada, measles vaccine protection is only available in the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.\u00a0Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. This is done with the MMR vaccine and other childhood vaccines for many reasons:\n\n\t\tChildren get the same protection as they do from individual vaccines were given separately\u20ac\u201dbut with fewer shots\n\n\t\tFewer shots may mean less pain for your child and less stress for you when the child is in pain/fewer vaccine appointments\n\n\t\tCombining vaccines into fewer shots may mean that more children will get recommended vaccinations on time. And that means fewer delays in disease protection for children\nThere is more information about combination vaccines under FAQ: Vaccine Safety\nImmunization Nurse\n",
