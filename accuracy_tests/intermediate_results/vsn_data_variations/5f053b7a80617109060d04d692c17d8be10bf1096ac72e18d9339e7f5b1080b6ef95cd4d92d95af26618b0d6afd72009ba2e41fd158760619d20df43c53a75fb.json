    "answer": "You do not need to have your blood drawn to see if you have measles immunity.\n\n\t\tFor all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (given as MMR) are recommended. Individuals born in 1970 or later with documentation of two doses of a measles-containing vaccine are considered immune and no booster doses are recommended.\u00a0\n\n\t\tIndividuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals.\nLearn more about measles and the MMR vaccine here.\nImmunization Nurse",
