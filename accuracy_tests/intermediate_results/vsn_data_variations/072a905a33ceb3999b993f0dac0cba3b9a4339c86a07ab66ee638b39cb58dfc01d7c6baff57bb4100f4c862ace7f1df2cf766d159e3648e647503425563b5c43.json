Many people who receive vaccines have no side effects. For those that do, the side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. Read more about vaccine safety.\nBefore getting a vaccine, your health care provider will tell you about the possible side effects of the vaccine(s). It's important to be open with your health care provider and ask any questions you may have. In BC, make an immunization appointment for your child at your local health unit or some doctors' offices. Use the health unit finder.\n",
