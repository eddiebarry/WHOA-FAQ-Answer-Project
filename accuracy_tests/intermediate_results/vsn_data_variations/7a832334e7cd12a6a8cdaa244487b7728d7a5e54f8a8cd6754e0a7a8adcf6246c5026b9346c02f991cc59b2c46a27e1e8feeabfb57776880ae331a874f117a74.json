    "answer": "In B.C., decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations from the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee. This expert scientific committee looks at statements issued by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization, the published literature, product monograph, as well as provincial epidemiology (how often the disease occurs in different groups of people in the province) and available health economic analyses. It also considers issues related to feasibility of implementation, resource requirements, and other related considerations. Recommendations for new vaccine programs or expansions are considered by the Ministry of Health against other new health initiatives.\nThe routine vaccines provided free for you and your child will provide protection against potentially serious diseases than can be effectively and safely prevented by vaccination.\u00a0\n",
