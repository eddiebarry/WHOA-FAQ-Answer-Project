    "answer": "In BC, ImmunizeBC is not aware of an immunization specific class online or in person for parents. Some prenatal classes and parenting classes may include information on vaccines. To discuss vaccines and your questions, you can speak with your health care provider, a nurse at your local health unit (use the health unit finder) or speak with a nurse at HealthlinkBC by calling 8-1-1 anytime. There are also many online resources that provide more information about vaccines. Online reading suggestions are here.\nImmunization Nurse",
