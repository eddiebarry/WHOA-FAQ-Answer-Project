    "answer": "Shingles is a painful skin rash with blisters. In some people who have had chickenpox, the virus becomes active again later in life and causes shingles. You cannot contract shingles from another person.\u00a0\nThe Shingrix\u00ae vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of getting shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) by more than 90% after two doses. The vaccine is given as two doses, at least two to six months apart. Protection might not be attained until the recommended number of doses has been administered. Please speak with the immunizing health care professional that gave you the shingles vaccine with more questions.\nImmunization Nurse",
