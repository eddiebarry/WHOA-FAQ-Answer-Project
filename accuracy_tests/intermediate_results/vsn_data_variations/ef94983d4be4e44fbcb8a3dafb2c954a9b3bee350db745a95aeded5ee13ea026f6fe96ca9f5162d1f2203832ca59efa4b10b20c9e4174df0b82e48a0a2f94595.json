    "answer": "Tips for locating immunization records are here. Contact the health unit where you lived as a child, use the health unit finder. Documentation from 1960s will be challenging to obtain, especially if vaccines were given by your doctor.\u00a0 In general:\n\n\t\tPersons born before 1970 (except health care workers) are considered immune to measles and mumps from having these diseases in childhood.\n\n\t\tBlood tests can be done for a few vaccine preventable diseases, but the need for these tests should be discussed with your health care provider.\n\n\t\tImmunizeBC does not have a timeline for blood tests/results.\n\n\t\tWithout a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection. It is safe to repeat vaccines. The schedule for these adults is located here.\nImmunization Nurse",
