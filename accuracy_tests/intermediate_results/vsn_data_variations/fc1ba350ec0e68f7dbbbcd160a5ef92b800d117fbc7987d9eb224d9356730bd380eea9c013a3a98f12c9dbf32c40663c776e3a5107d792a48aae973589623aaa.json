    "answer": "Vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines strengthen the immune system and make it ready to fight vaccine-preventable diseases. They harness and train it to quickly defend against vaccine-preventable diseases before illness can occur. Vaccines greatly reduce the risk of infection by working with the body's natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease. The immune system uses several tools to fight infection. It enlists the help of white blood cells to fight infection, produce antibodies and make cells called memory cells, which go into action quickly if the body encounters the same germ again.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
