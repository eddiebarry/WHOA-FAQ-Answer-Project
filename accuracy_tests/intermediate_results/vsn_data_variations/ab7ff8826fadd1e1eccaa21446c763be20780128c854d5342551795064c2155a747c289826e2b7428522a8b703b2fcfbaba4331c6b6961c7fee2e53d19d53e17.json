    "answer": "A full dose of a vaccine must be given to ensure your child is fully protected and a partial dose is considered invalid. In BC, children 4-6 years of age receive the Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis-Polio (Tdap-IPV) vaccine called Adacel\u00ae-Polio or Boostrix\u00ae-Polio. You need to book with your doctor or local health unit to repeat the full dose (0.5ml) of the Tdap-IPV vaccine. Find a health unit near you here.\nImmunization Nurse",
