    "answer": "The publicly funded (free) influenza vaccine is purchased by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with money allocated by the Ministry of Health and is distributed through the local health authorities.\u00a0 The provincial supply of the publicly funded influenza vaccine is determined prior to the actual influenza season based on information from each of the health authorities.\u00a0 Thus, each health authority receives a pre-determined amount of the publicly-funded vaccine.\nDepending on the particular demand in a given year, in a specific area or at a specific location, sometimes select clinics may run out of the publicly funded vaccine. The publicly funded vaccine is available from a variety of vaccine providers, including public health clinics, pharmacies, travel clinics and some doctors' offices.\nIn BC, the influenza vaccine is publicly funded for people at high risk of serious illness from influenza, people able to transmit or spread influenza to those at high risk of serious illness from influenza,\u00a0people who provide essential community services, and farmers and other people who work with live poultry. A list of people eligible for the publicly funded influenza vaccine can be found here.\nAnyone not eligible for the publicly funded vaccine can purchase it privately from a number of pharmacies and travel clinics.\u00a0 This is a separate supply of vaccine purchased by the clinic from the vaccine supplier.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\n",
