    "answer": "Vaccines are among the safest medical products available and the side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. It is often hard to tell if a reaction was caused by the vaccine, or if it was caused by something else. We recommend that you speak with your public health nurse or family physician to discuss your question. They can have a more indepth discussion with you and answer any questions you have about vaccines. You can find the number for your local health unit here.\nImmunization Nurse\n",
