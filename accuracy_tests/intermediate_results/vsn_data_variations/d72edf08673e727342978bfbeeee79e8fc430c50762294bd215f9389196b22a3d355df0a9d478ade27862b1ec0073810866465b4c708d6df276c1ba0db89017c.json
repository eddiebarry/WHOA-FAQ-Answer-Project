    "answer": "In BC, seniors and any individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine is not recommended for these individuals. This means those who had measles in childhood do not need a measles containing vaccine because they are immune from having the actual disease. In BC, 1969 was the first year a measles vaccine was offered.\nIf you were born before 1970 and uncertain whether you had measles, speak with your health care provider, Read more about measles.\nImmunization Nurse",
