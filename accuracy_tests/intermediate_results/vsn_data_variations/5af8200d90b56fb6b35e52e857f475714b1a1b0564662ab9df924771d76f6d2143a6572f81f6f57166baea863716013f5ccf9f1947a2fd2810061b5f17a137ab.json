In clinical studies a single injection of MMR vaccine caused measles antibodies to develop in 95% of children with no previous history of measles (from disease or vaccination).\u00a0 \u00a0In BC, there is no recommendation to receive the 2nd dose of MMR vaccine earlier (i.e., before 4 years of age).\nIndividuals most at risk from measles are those who are completely unvaccinated against the disease.\u00a0Those who are concerned about their potential measles exposure but have no symptoms can call HealthlinkBC at 8-1-1 and speak to a nurse.\nImmunization Nurse",
