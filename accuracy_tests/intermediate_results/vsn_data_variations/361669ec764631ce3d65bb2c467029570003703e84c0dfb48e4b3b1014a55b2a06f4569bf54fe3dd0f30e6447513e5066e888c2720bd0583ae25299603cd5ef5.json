    "answer": "The free influenza vaccine (flu shot) is available from public health clinics, some doctor's offices and most pharmacies. Since 2009 in BC, pharmacists have been providing influenza vaccines to the general public and each year, an increasing number of people choose to receive their influenza vaccines at their local pharmacies. As a result, many health units focus on children (and their families) as pharmacists do not vaccinate children less than five years of age.\nIf you want to receive your influenza vaccine from your local health unit, contact them directly to ask if they are offering any appointments or drop in clinics.
