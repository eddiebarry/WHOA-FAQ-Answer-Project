    "answer": "In BC, we have a schedule to offer vaccines to children 7-17 years of age who are behind in routine vaccines. Find your local public health unit here. Call the health unit to make an appointment for your grandson. State that it is his first time receiving vaccines. The nurse will\u00a0determine a vaccine schedule for him based on his age, health status, lifestyle or job risk factors,\u00a0etc.\u00a0\nIt is much safer to get a vaccine than risk the complications of a vaccine preventable disease. Vaccine information, including safety will be discussed at the appointment and you can ask questions. In general, most vaccine side effects are minor and only last a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare.\u00a0You can read more about vaccine safety here.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse",
