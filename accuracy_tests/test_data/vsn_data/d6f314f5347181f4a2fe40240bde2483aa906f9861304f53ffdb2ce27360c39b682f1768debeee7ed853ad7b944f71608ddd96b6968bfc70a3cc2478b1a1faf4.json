    "answer": "There are a number of reasons why people may get influenza (flu)-like symptoms even after they have been vaccinated against influenza:\n\n\t\tA person may become ill from other respiratory viruses that cause symptoms similar to influenza, like respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, or parainfluenza. There are many different types of viruses that can cause influenza-like symptoms. \u00a0The influenza vaccines only protect against influenza, not other illnesses.\n\n\t\t\u00a0It's possible to be exposed to an influenza virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the two-week period after vaccination that it takes the body to develop immune protection.\u00a0\n\n\t\tA person may be exposed to an influenza virus that the vaccine does not protect against. There are many different influenza viruses. The influenza vaccine protects against the strains of influenza viruses that health experts think will cause influenza during that particular season.\u00a0\n\n\t\tThe influenza vaccine can vary in how well it works and some people who get vaccinated may still get sick.\u00a0\n\n\t\tSome people mistake the \"stomach flu\" for influenza. \u00a0Influenza vaccines do not protect against the viruses or bacteria that cause stomach illnesses, often called the stomach flu. Influenza is a respiratory illness and not a stomach illness.\u00a0\n- Immunization Nurse\u00a0\n",
