    "answer": "Once a vaccine has been approved for use, and for as long as the vaccine is used, its safety is continuously monitored. Canada has several systems in place (at the local, provincial and national level) to carefully monitor for adverse events and to detect any vaccine safety concerns. Read more about vaccine safety monitoring here.\u00a0 As part of informed consent, health care providers review the common reactions and what to do if there is a serious or unexpected reaction for each vaccine.\nAn adverse event following immunization (also known as an AEFI) is a serious or unexpected reaction that happens after someone receives a vaccine. An adverse event may or may not have been caused by the vaccine. If you are concerned that your child may have a serious or unexpected reaction after a vaccine, contact the health care provider who gave the vaccine. Under the Public Health Act in BC, all health care providers who become aware of an AEFI must report it.\u00a0\nImmunization Nurse\n",
