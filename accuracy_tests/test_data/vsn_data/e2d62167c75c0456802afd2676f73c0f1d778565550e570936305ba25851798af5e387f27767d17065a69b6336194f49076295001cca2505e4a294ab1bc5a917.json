    "answer": "A toxoid vaccine protects against the toxin made by certain bacteria (e.g. tetanus). Toxoid vaccines are safe because they cannot cause the disease they prevent. The toxin has been inactivated (killed) so it has been made harmless, but it teaches the immune system to recognize and protect you against that bacteria (e.g. diphtheria). According to the History of Immunization in BC, in the 1940s the following vaccines were offered for protection against diphtheria and tetanus:\n\n\t\tTABT vaccine 1943 Tetanus toxoid, typhoid, paratyphoid A and B\n\n\t\tDPT 1948 Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus\n\n\t\tDiphtheria (40 LF) and tetanus (DT)\u00a01948 Primary immunization only\n\n\tIt is recommended and publicly funded (free) for adults to receive the\u00a0Td vaccine every 10 years in BC.
