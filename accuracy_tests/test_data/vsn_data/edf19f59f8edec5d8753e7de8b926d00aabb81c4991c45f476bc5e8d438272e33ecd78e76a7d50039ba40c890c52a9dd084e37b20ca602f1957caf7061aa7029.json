    "answer": "For optimal protection, it is advised that you adhere as closely as possible to the recommended immunization schedule. However, in certain circumstances, including travel, it may be recommended that infants get vaccinated early. Some of the 2 month vaccines can be given as early as 6 weeks of age and others as early as 8 weeks of age. \nIt is likely an option for your child to get immunized while in the US.\u00a0\u00a0You can contact a public health clinic in the area where you will be staying to find out where your child can get immunized and for information regarding available vaccines and cost.\u00a0\u00a0If you plan to have your child immunized in the US, take your child's Health Passport/immunization record with you and be sure to bring a record of your child's immunizations back with you to Canada. \nWe recommend that you speak with a public health nurse or your family doctor who can make a recommendation for your child.\u00a0\u00a0You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here:\u00a0http://immunizebc.ca/finder.",
