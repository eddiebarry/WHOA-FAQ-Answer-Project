    "answer": "In Canada, many infant and childhood vaccines have ingredients (such as aluminum salts) to help the vaccine to be more effective. In the first 6 months of life, infants receive more aluminum in their diet than from vaccines. Aluminum is used in vaccines as an adjuvant (help improve the immune response to a vaccine) and has been safely used in vaccines for over 70 years.\u00a0You can read more about vaccine safety and aluminum content in vaccines here.\nThe amount of aluminum in vaccines is very small and regulated by Health Canada to meet the World Health Organization's standards.\u00a0A list of the ingredients in each vaccine can be found in the vaccine's product monograph on\u00a0Health Canada's Drug Product Database.\nImmunization Nurse",
