    "answer": "In 2004 chicken pox vaccine was available to susceptible children at school entry and in Grade 6 (those born in 1999 and 1993 respectively). In 2005 it was added to the infant schedule at 12 months (infants born on or after January 1, 2004). Starting in 2005 there was also a catch up program for susceptible children 18-48 months. Prior to that, it was available for purchase in 2002 but not part of the regular program. If you have any further questions regarding this, please call your local public health unit. You will find the number here. You can also find more information about chicken pox here.\nImmunization Nurse",
