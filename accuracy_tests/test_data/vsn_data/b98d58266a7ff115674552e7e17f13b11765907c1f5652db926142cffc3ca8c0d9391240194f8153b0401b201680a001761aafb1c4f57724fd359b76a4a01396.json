    "answer": "We recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse. \u00a0If following this discussion you decide that you would still like for your child to receive only one vaccine at a time (per clinic visit) this can be accommodated.\nSome information to consider: A number of studies have shown that there is no greater risk for side effects when vaccines are given together (at the same clinic visit) than if they were to be given individually.\u00a0 For best protection, it is recommended that children are immunized according to the routine schedule.\u00a0 Spacing out or delaying vaccines leaves children at risk for serious diseases when they need the protection most. Spacing out or delaying vaccines also increases the number of office visits and time spent getting your child's shots.\u00a0\nYou can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.\u00a0\n",
