    "answer": "In general, it is recommended that children receive all of the vaccines recommended for children of their age in the country where they live.\u00a0 We recommend that you speak with your health care provider in Japan who can make a recommendation for your child.\u00a0\nWhen you arrive in BC, it is recommended that you take your child's immunization record to a public health unit to be checked. Routine childhood immunizations often differ between countries. A public health nurse can review your child's record and recommend and provide any missing routine vaccines for free.\u00a0\nYou can find the contact information for your local public health unit here:\u00a0http://www.immunizebc.ca/finder.\u00a0\n",
