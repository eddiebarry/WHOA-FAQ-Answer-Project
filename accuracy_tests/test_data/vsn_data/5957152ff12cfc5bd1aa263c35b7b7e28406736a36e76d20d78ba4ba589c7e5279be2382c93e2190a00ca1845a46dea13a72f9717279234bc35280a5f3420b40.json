    "answer": "If you are referring to the side effects or reactions that can occur after getting a vaccine, many people who receive vaccines have no reaction. For those that do, the side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. They happen soon after the shot is given and will generally go away after a day or two. You can also find more information on each of the vaccines that are given at the 2 month visit here. Click on the vaccine name and it will take you to the HealthLinkBC file for that vaccine. If you have further questions, please call your immunization provider or your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You will find the number here.\nImmunization Nurse",
