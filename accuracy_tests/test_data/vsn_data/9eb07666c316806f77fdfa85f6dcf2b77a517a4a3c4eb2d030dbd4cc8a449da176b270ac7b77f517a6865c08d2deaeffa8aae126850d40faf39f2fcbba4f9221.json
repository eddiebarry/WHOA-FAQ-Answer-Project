However, the\u00a0Ontario immunization schedule is different, so bring your baby's BC vaccine records to the appointment. Also, if/when you return to BC ask a nurse at your local health unit to review your baby's vaccine records as they may require additional vaccines/doses. In BC, use the health unit finder to book an immunization appointment.\n\tImmunization Nurse\n\u00a0\n",
