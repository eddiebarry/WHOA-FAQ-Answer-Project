    "answer": "The side effects of the flu vaccine are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. In addition to\u00a0 putting a cool cloth on the arm where your child got the vaccine, pain medication is fine.
